She is the author of two forthcoming books: </em>Literary Witches<em> (Hachette/ Seal 2017), a collaboration with illustrator Katy Horan, and </em>Ask Baba Yaga<em> (Andrews McMeel 2017), based on her advice column in </em>The Hairpin<em>. Her poetry can be found in literary journals such as </em>Crazyhorse, Guernica, Fence,<em> and many more. Poems from her “Queen Harp” manuscript will be published in the upcoming Translucent Issue of </em>Fairy Tale Review<em>. I interviewed her about the influences of folklore in her work, her portrayals of feminine characters, and various witches.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Baba Yaga is a witch from Slavic folklore and mythology, and you invoke her character in an advice column and your upcoming book, <em>Ask Baba Yaga</em>. What was your first introduction to this mythology? Was there a particular story you remember being told, or one that has become your favorite?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before my family moved to America, when I was five years old, we lived in a city called Irkutsk by Lake Baikal in southern Siberia. We had a summer house, or dachyaâ&#128;&#148;almost everybody in Russia, at the time, had a summer houseâ&#128;&#148;edged between the lake and the woods. These were deep woods, very magical and mysterious; one of my earliest memories is of my parents saying I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t go berry picking with them because we might run into bears. I must have heard about Baba Yaga early on, because I knew that she lived in those woods along with the bears. I felt her nearby, creeping around, making concoctions in her hut that moved around on chicken legs. Even when we went back to Irkutsk, she was close. I remember taking a walk with my mother through a city park and seeing Baba Yagaâ&#128;&#153;s face in the hollowed-out part of a tree.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Every story begins with a story that you already know: something that is entrenched in your core despite it seeming completely foreign at firstâ&#128;&#148;the moment when you realize that you dislike the bitter taste of almonds; the sight of your own blood as you dab at it with your thumbâ&#128;&#148;the scarlet seeping into the ridges of your fingerprints before you rinse your body of itself clear in the bathroom sink.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the edge of my bed, a bookshelf filled with hardcoversâ&#128;&#148;texts that I could call â&#128;&#156;mineâ&#128;&#157; in a way that children claim things; all things received as a gift; the ornate pages, the gold trim that I would scratch at with my fingernails if I hadnâ&#128;&#153;t already bitten them to flatness. The stories, too, were mine: girls and boys and frogs and toads rooted to my stomach, curving their way around the bumps in my spine, as if they had always been there, just beneath the surface, leaving their marks on the inside of my skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The games too, were mine, in a different way: whereas the stories of my youth were found within, as if they had been stitched into my core, the games were explosive in their momentsâ&#128;&#148;they burst into my world from the exterior, and it was my duty to capture those days sitting on a stained carpet in an upstairs hallway trying to make this other version of myself run fast enough that the boomerang would get lost amongst the rocks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These too, were stories that I already knew: of awakening in a land where all things are equal and the touch of a fleck of light could kill you where you stoodâ&#128;&#148;these stories of danger, or warning, of beware the outside, but push forward toward an unknown end and eat all of the fruit whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a time when I would have to shut the game off, but I could enter a different world through the pages at the foot of my bed, often scanning the same stories over and over before it was time to put my glasses on the nightstand and let all worlds blur. Some nights, when the room was too warm from the heat of all of the electronics, I could see the images of the parallax scrolling still engrained in the darkness, glowing a warm red, even when all of the lights were outâ&#128;&#148;a constant revisiting, as if I were the vacuum tube casting images against the blackened windows.</p>

From a distance, these painted sections blended with the sky so well that the wall seemed to disappear: it ceased, for a moment, to be a barricade, a reminder that the Global North is fortifying itself against the Global South. FernÃ¡ndezâ&#128;&#153;s work reminds me of the fairy tales of my childhood, where the edges of forests are boundaries between known and unknown worlds. In those stories, borders function as thresholds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Ambos Nogales, where I volunteer at <a href="http://ediblebajaarizona.com/displaced-hunger">el Comedor</a>, an aid station and soup kitchen for recently deported migrants, the border wall starts outside of town. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a rust-colored snake that wriggles across the hill crests before descending into the city itself. It cleaves the broad avenues and beige-brick buildings of sleepy Arizona from the narrow streets and tumble of vendor carts and pharmacies of urban Sonora–cleaves city from suburb, Mexico from the US, â&#128;&#156;themâ&#128;&#157; from â&#128;&#156;us.â&#128;&#157; On Sundays, families picnic along the fence, cousins with Mexican citizenship passing Coca-Cola and condiments to cousins with US citizenship, holding hands instead of embracing. The border here is porous enough for fingers, voices, shared meals; for lives to be lived across and between–but not permeable enough for whole bodies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Iâ&#128;&#153;m a gring@ from north of the line; I live in a country where politicians and public intellectuals fuel fears that legions of people from Mexico and Central America are crossing north to take jobs away from US citizens and to, God forbid, speak Spanish while browsing the supermarket. In his poem <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO5tvz3GvrE">â&#128;&#156;187 Reasons Why Mexicanos Canâ&#128;&#153;t Cross the Border,â&#128;&#157;</a> Juan Felipe Herrera writes, â&#128;&#156;CANâ&#128;&#153;T CROSS because â&#128;&#152;xenophobiaâ&#128;&#153; is a politically correct term.â&#128;&#157; <em>Secure borders!</em> US conservatives scream, and <em>Xenophobia!</em> the liberals respond–a cloaked word that doesnâ&#128;&#153;t sound quite as bad or honest as <em>racist</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also live in a country that just elected Donald Trump to the presidency–a man who <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-outrageous-comments-mexicans-article-1.2773214">once said</a>, â&#128;&#156;When Mexico sends its people, theyâ&#128;&#153;re not sending their best â&#128;¦ Theyâ&#128;&#153;re sending people that have lots of problems, and theyâ&#128;&#153;re bringing those problems with them. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re bringing drugs. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re bringing crime.â&#128;&#157; But heâ&#128;&#153;s wrong–those are not most of the people crossing north, and theyâ&#128;&#153;re certainly not most of the people Iâ&#128;&#153;ve met and talked to: undocumented millennials who grew up in the United States, were deported, and are trying to get back to Chicago, Phoenix, or California; families fleeing gang violence and economic poverty in Honduras and El Salvador; a Oaxacan university student whose visa application was rejected by the Mexican government because he looked â&#128;&#156;too indigenous,â&#128;&#157; and came from a family without wealth or social standing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Herreraâ&#128;&#153;s poem also includes the portentous line, â&#128;&#156;CANâ&#128;&#153;T CROSS because brown is the color of the future,â&#128;&#157; which hints at the dream that someday Mexicans, Central Americans, and other migrants will be able to travel north freely. Herrera and other writers and artists are making a new mythology of the border: Prefiguring what could be and should be, they transform the militarized line into a threshold. â&#128;&#156;I see a whole generation … wandering around // a continent without a name,â&#128;&#157; Guillermo GÃ³mez-PeÃ±a writes in â&#128;&#156;Freefalling Towards a Borderless Future,â&#128;&#157; Â â&#128;&#156;Standing on the map of my political desires // I toast to a borderless future // (I raise my wine glass toward the moon).â&#128;&#157; Queer, Chicana writer Gloria AnzÃ¡ldua–who grew up in the borderlands of south Texas–considers the northward migrations a â&#128;&#156;return odyssey to the historical/mythological AztlÃ¡n,â&#128;&#157; the original Southwestern homeland of the Aztecs which, according to AnzaldÃºa, they â&#128;&#156;left â&#128;¦ in 1168 AD,â&#128;&#157; bound for the Valley of Mexico. â&#128;&#156;This land was Mexican once, // was Indian always // and is. // And Â Â Â Â will be again,â&#128;&#157; she writes in her poem <em>El otro Mexico</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In October 2015, Ana Teresa FernÃ¡ndez and a group of volunteers painted a 50-foot section of the border wall in Nogales, Mexico the color of the sky. In April 2016, volunteers in the Mexican border cities of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Mexicali, and Agua Prieta did the same. With each brush stroke, they enacted the projectâ&#128;&#153;s name, <a href="http://anateresafernandez.com/1718-2/"><em>Borrando La Frontera</em></a>. They offered those on the south side of the wall a vision of what they might someday see looking north–after the steel, barbed wire, and Border Patrol trucks that divide the two countries dissolve, there will be nothing but houses, schools, mountains, mesquite trees, clouds in a hot desert sky.</p>

Sonya currently lives in Seattle with their cat, Magpie Underfoot, and a growing collection of taxidermy, wet specimens, and other oddities. </em>Salt Is For Curing<em> (Sator Press, 2015) is their full-length debut â&#128;&#148; a poetry collection about bones, dill, and survival. Sonya’s poems, essays, and interviews have appeared in </em>Entropy, Lodown, The Hairpin, VIDA, The Poetry Foundation,<em> and other publications, and their chapbook </em>My Heart In Aspic<em> is available from Porkbelly Press. They hold a BA in Linguistics with minors in German Linguistics and Finnish from the University of Washington.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983243735"><em>Salt is for Curing</em></a> is a dark and delicious book. Your poetry is teeming with folklore and food, evoking a hunger that simmers in magic. Blood, bones, vegetables, herbs mingle with robbers, wolves, Baba Yaga, Ivan the Fool. There is bread and there are potions. Ripe plums and Koschei the Deathless. Youâ&#128;&#153;ve said â&#128;&#156;Thereâ&#128;&#153;s not really a divide between folklore and myâ&#128;¦ sense of self â&#128;&#148; at least the stories I had told to me as a child, and thatâ&#128;&#153;s usually what Iâ&#128;&#153;m referencing in poetry.â&#128;&#157;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Which figure from Russian fairy tales did you most identify with as a child? In whom do you see yourself now? Did you connect more deeply with male or female characters as a child, and has that changed?</strong></p>
<p>The one I felt pulled to was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koschei">Koschei Bessmertniy</a>, though not in an identifying type of way â&#128;&#148; more like I wanted to be his lover or flunky or something. I never ever cast myself as a hero, and I canâ&#128;&#153;t decide if thatâ&#128;&#153;s because I was a timid child or because I had such a strong sense of ego that I disliked role-playing as someone other than myself. Maybe both. â&#128;&#156;Male-adjacentâ&#128;&#157; is a good way of describing how I connected with characters, though. I internalized gender roles enough to know I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t be Koschei, but youâ&#128;&#153;d never find me in Baba Yagaâ&#128;&#153;s camp either. I was really intimidated by female characters. Baba Yaga scared the shit out of me, to the point where I didnâ&#128;&#153;t even like her as a folktale figure, whereas Koschei was bae.</p>

The wizard duel in the animated film <em>The Sword In The Stone</em>, for one, but more traditionally the plot of several Celtic ballads. “The Ballad of Tam-Lin” was included in a book of folktales I had as a child, translated from song to prose. I remember loving it. I remember the way the name â&#128;&#156;Tam-Linâ&#128;&#157; felt on my Russian tongue, liquid and strong. For those unfamiliar with the story, it goes like this: a girl comes upon Tam-Lin in the woods of Carterhaugh, where he is being held prisoner by the Queen of Fairies. To rescue him from the Queen and win him as a lover, the girl must hold him fast through countless transformations: a roaring lion, a terrifying snake, the painful scald of flame. To my young sensibilities, this seemed extremely romantic. I appreciated the ritual of endurance; trials and pageantry were a necessity of love stories because some outside force willed it, not because of the lovers themselves. Years later, “The Ballad of Tam-Lin” made me pissed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Granted, what sounds romantic to a four-year-old-girl can hardly be expected to ring true to a thirty-year-old non binary queer person. All the same, I wanted to slice apart this story with my feminist lance â&#128;&#148; which is like a feminist lens, but for folktales. The basic premise of “Tam-Lin,” where a woman holds a man as he hurts her, was no longer abstract but a common narrative played out through a million books and films fetishizing a womanâ&#128;&#153;s abnegation and self-sacrifice for the sake of a manâ&#128;&#153;s potential. “Tam-Lin” became our cultureâ&#128;&#153;s unfortunate connection between pain and love, equating the latter with a willingness to suffer on behalf of another. â&#128;&#156;Itâ&#128;&#153;s only true if you bruise by the force of it,â&#128;&#157; as Chris Corner once said. Fuck. What had originally drawn me to such a sexist, heteronormative depiction of devotion? A poem from my poetry collection,<em> Salt Is For Curing</em>, tried to understand: â&#128;&#156;She holds and she hurts and / she wins. Maybe I liked it because the woman / is doing something, not waiting. It’s always / either waiting or hurting, you know, and often / one canâ&#128;&#153;t tell the difference.â&#128;&#157;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet the more I thought about it, the more “The Ballad of Tam-Lin” seemed itself to change shape, to become something other than what I had previously seen. As I looked back on an extremely difficult period of my life when I frequently lashed out in anger and attempted to isolate myself from those around me â&#128;&#148; and as I thought about the people who remained by my side throughout this â&#128;&#148; I began to see “Tam-Lin” not as a patriarchal narrative of pain-acceptance but as one where a character holds another through change. Tam-Lin did not become a flame and slowly burn hotter; he shifted indiscriminately, the changes done to him as he assumed monstrous forms akin to those in body-horror films like <em>The Fly</em> or <em>Tusk</em>. The transformation chase in “Tam-Lin” is a battle against the Fairy Queen and not really between the two individuals. In this forest, the courage required in love is made literal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be forcibly changed, especially as a means of achieving freedom, is a strong metaphor that does double-duty here: the girl can leave the forest and head home any time, but enduring the transformations is the only way for Tam-Lin to escape the Fairy Queen. Someone we love can certainly assume different shapes to frighten or hurt us, but the experiences that make us shift and change are as varied as all the animals in the wood of Carterhaugh. Which is to say: is it possible that there is something beautiful in loveâ&#128;&#153;s tenacity? Not in the sense that itâ&#128;&#153;s good or admirable to endure pain, but in the sense that a transformation chase represents the monstrous qualities people display as they pass through tragedy â&#128;&#148; the qualities we might take on during the processing of grief or trauma. This link of change with pain, especially in the context of external pain (vis-Ã -vis the Fairy Queen), is in some ways a very honest look at any long-term relationship, where we must each see the otherâ&#128;&#153;s wounds and mold each other back into, if not our perfect form, then at least something passable. A transformation chase is not discomfort for the sake of another but the choice to remain by their side in a moment of shared discomfort â&#128;&#148; because, after all, it is only in fairy tales that change can happen with something as easy as a kiss.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A note for readers: this essay mentions physical and sexual violence.Â </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once I tried reading a 900-page book called <i>A Treasury of American Folklore</i>, by the folklorist B.A. Botkin. But I only got 60 pages in before dumping the â&#128;&#156;treasureâ&#128;&#157; at a book swap.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was the stories of Mike Fink that did it, a Mississippi River boatman of the post-American Revolution era celebrated for his outrageous boasts and pranks. His boasts were of the variety that he could â&#128;&#156;outrun, outjump, outshoot, outdrink, and lick any man in the country.â&#128;&#157; And his pranks? Well, he had a curious sense of fun, this Mike Fink, and a suspiciously specific kind of targets. Like the time he shot an African-American boy walking by in the heel just because he didnâ&#128;&#153;t like its shape, and the time he shot the scalp-lock off a Cherokee manâ&#128;&#153;s head for acting too proud, or the time he made his wife lie in a pile of leaves and set them on fire, letting her go just after her hair and clothes started burning, all for looking at another man.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Botkin labels Fink a â&#128;&#156;pseudo bad manâ&#128;&#157; without explaining what that means. Along with many other folklorists whoâ&#128;&#153;ve written about Fink, he tries to assure us modern folks that Fink wasnâ&#128;&#153;t real, or at least, his pranks werenâ&#128;&#153;t. They couldnâ&#128;&#153;t be, could they?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though Iâ&#128;&#153;d never heard of Mike Fink before this, I donâ&#128;&#153;t need any academic or historical investigation to know he was real. That he is real. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve known him. Maybe you have too. Maybe like me, you see him every day on the news, in life, in the memory of personal experience. Sometimes he wears a badge, sometimes a suit. Sometimes heâ&#128;&#153;s followed me on the street or leered at me on the train. When I was young I sometimes encountered him on the playground or in the school hallway, trying to lift up my skirt or grab some part of me. More than once Iâ&#128;&#153;ve loved him and forgiven him. Sometimes heâ&#128;&#153;s the picture of everything all good and charming. Oftentimes heâ&#128;&#153;s put in charge of things, more than just riverboats, like committees, lawsâ&#128;&#148;and bodies, usually black, brown, and female.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think now, this election year, heâ&#128;&#153;s too close for comfort to being put in charge of the whole country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I dumped that treasury of American folklore because I was too angry and ashamed to see what else was in the folk history of the United States, what further ugliness my countryâ&#128;&#153;s mythology had to reveal. The book confirmed what Iâ&#128;&#153;ve always known about my country, and my place as a woman in it, but donâ&#128;&#153;t often like to face. I canâ&#128;&#153;t afford to ignore the truth and cost of such â&#128;&#156;treasureâ&#128;&#157; anymore. Mike Fink is deserving of dumping. America needs the coinage of a new, transformative folklore.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>In 2014, when I began studying fairy tales, I came across Pauline Greenhill’s <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/41388863?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">“‘Fitcher’s [Queer] Bird’: A Fairy-Tale Heroine and Her Avatars,”</a>Â  an academic article that offers a queer reading of <a href="http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/bluebeard/stories/fitchersbird.html">“Fitcher’s Bird,”</a> my favorite Grimm fairy tale. The article has deeply influenced my thinking and writing on fairy tales and so I was thrilled when, after sending off an email to Greenhill, she agreed to an interview.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Greenhill is Professor of Womenâ&#128;&#153;s and Gender Studies at the University of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Her most recent book is </em>Screening Justice: Canadian Crime Films, Culture and Society<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> which was co-edited with Steven Kohm and Sonia Bookman, and published in 2016. She also co-edited </em>Fairy-Tale Films Beyond Disney: International Perspectives<em> with Jack Zipes and Kendra Magnus-Johnston in 2016; </em>Unsettling Assumptions: Tradition, Gender, Drag<em> with Diane Tye in 2014; </em>Channeling Wonder: Fairy Tales on Television<em> with Jill Terry Rudy in 2014; </em>Transgressive Tales: Queering the Grimms<em> with Kay Turner in 2012; and </em>Fairy Tale Films: Visions of Ambiguity<em> with Sidney Eve Matrix in 2010. She is the author of </em>Make the Night Hideous: Four English Canadian Charivaris, 1881-1940<em> (2010). She has fairy-tale research published in </em>Feral Feminisms; Law, Culture and the Humanities; Marvels & Tales; Narrative Culture; Studies in European Cinema; <em>and </em>Theoretical Criminology<em> among others.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>There’s a storied tradition of studying fairy tales through a feminist lens, but you take that work further, examining queerness in fairy tales. How did you find your way into this field of research?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Absolutely my queer/trans research is an extension of my feminist research! But my route to queer and trans fairy tales was circuitous. I started a masters in Folklore at Memorial University in St. Johnâ&#128;&#153;s, Newfoundland in 1977. At the time, and to a sad extent now, the cool kids avoided traditionally recognised forms of folklore like ballads and fairy tales. Trying to be one of them, I did my masters thesis on family photography.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, when I got to the University of Texas at Austin in 1981, where I did my PhD, I worked with Roger deV. Renwick, a ballad and folk song scholar who has always been an advocate for studying traditional genres (see e.g. Renwick 1980 and 2009). So for my PhD dissertation on folk poetry in Ontario under Rogerâ&#128;&#153;s supervision, I was looking for the old in the new, as it were (Greenhill 1989).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After five years teaching Canadian Studies at the University of Waterloo, I came to the University of Winnipegâ&#128;&#153;s (then) Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Studies program in 1991. (Weâ&#128;&#153;re now a Department with six full time faculty and weâ&#128;&#153;ve included â&#128;&#156;and Gender.â&#128;&#157;) At the time I was working on Newfoundland ballads about women who dress as men to follow their lovers or seek adventure as sailors, soldiers, or robbers. You can listen to one example <a href="http://tidido.com/a35184374041547/al55f091c6a5f39075733cc084/t55f091c7a5f39075733cc127">here</a>, sung by the fabulous Newfoundland traditional source singer Anita Best on the compilation album <i>Bristolâ&#128;&#153;s Hope–Lately Come Over</i>. Hitherto folkloristsâ&#128;&#153; readings assumed that these songs were about men and their experiences, and my feminist reading asserted that they were also about women.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I picture my mother at the helm of a boat somewhere in the thick of ocean. Floating behind the boat is a glacier, a compression of quiet grace. My mother has tied a thousand ancient ropes to the glacier and is pulling it through the water with the same conviction that I imagine Moses had when he parted the sea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-534" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-1024x681.jpg" alt="16286584359_778ff002ed_k" width="660" height="439" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-1024x681.jpg 1024w,https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-300x199.jpg 300w,https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-768x510.jpg 768w,https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For years, she has whispered her plan to us. Before they all melt, my mother wants to transport a glacier from Alaska to wherever my sister and I are living, so that we will have a secure source of water. To keep it from melting, she will coat the glacier in sawdust, as if sprinkling confectioner’s sugar on a slice of bundt cake. Then, she will chain it to a tugboat and tow it across the ocean, where it will finally be left in a dry pond or a desert’s scorched riverbed so that my sister and I will not die of thirst. We have always rolled our eyes to this idea. <em>Impossible,</em> we’ve said. But, recently, I’ve wondered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the night of her seventieth birthday, my mother told my sister and I that some scientists believe the moon was once part of the earth. This theory surmises that when the moon separated from the earth, the Pacific Ocean was formed in its void. We were eating pineapple-upside-down cake in the flicker of candlelight, she was wearing a white kimono and a halo made from fourteen carmine flowers, and my sister and I balked at the idea. But my mother insisted until my sister googled it. <em>It’s called the fission hypothesis,</em> my sister says. <em>I guess I have to get a PhD,</em> my mother responded with a tilt of her halo,<em> for people to listen to me.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over a decade ago, my mother had a theory that the energy from the moving bodies at gyms or playgrounds could be used for electricity. When she and I walked past fitness centers with treadmills in the windows, she pointed to the sweating bodies and said,<em> Imagine how many light bulbs they could be powering?</em> My eyes went from the runners’ wet, mangled hair to the ceiling, where fluorescent lights hummed incessantly above their heads, but I wasn’t convinced. Years later, my sister saw an advertisement: a company was utilizing the velocity of playing children to power electrical outlets in a playground.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maybe Iâ&#128;&#153;m wrong to not believe that you can part the sea, that a body can run enough to flash on a light bulb, that the moon can slice itself from the earth and spiral out into the knitted black of the sky. Maybe I am wrong to not picture the glacier, hulking and glossy, rising over the sea like a skyscraper; to not look closely at this image until I can see my mother’s reflection in the ice, waving at the distant sight of land, her salty seaweed hair swept into the sea-wind, rough waves smacking against the sides of the boat. If I look even closer, I will discern on my mother’s face not only the knowledge that her family’s thirst will forever be quenched, but also that now, after all these years, they will maybe, finally, believe her.</p>

You are a girl, and where there is a girl there is a story. A story about a girl.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your mother will give you a bag. Maybe a fine leather satchel, or maybe a rough sack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It will be much heavier than it appears.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your mother cannot speak, so she cross-stitches her warning to you. Her thimbled finger pushes the needle that pulls the thread. She spells it out so you see her words framed by pine above your pillow. Each day you wake to them, and each night you bed down beneath them:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Do not go into the deep dark woods alone.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You hear the story of your mother from the women of the village, so often that you know it by heart. The old wives tell their tale. Your ears grow heavy to carry. Sometimes the women are raccoons chittering, sometimes birds wide-beaked and screeching grief. You want quiet. You want dark. You want to be alone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You set off carrying your motherâ&#128;&#153;s bag.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From inside the wolfâ&#128;&#153;s belly, you donâ&#128;&#153;t hear the old wives at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Still. You know their story, by heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Your mother lost her voice to the jaws of a wolf. She went into the deep dark woods alone, with her basket in hand. She was plucking mushrooms from the good rot when the wolf came upon her. He caught her by the neck. At the last moment, a hunter saved her. He drove his knife through the beastâ&#128;&#153;s belly. Soon you grew in hers. The hunter built your house. The hunter brought meat. But the hunter did too break your motherâ&#128;&#153;s bones.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From inside the wolfâ&#128;&#153;s belly, you can hear the hunters swarm for rescue. You stay very quiet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They will leave, with their knives and axes and arrows. You will begin to chew.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You are a girl, and where there is a girl there is a story. A story about a girl.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old wives will tell this story of you:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The girl went into the deep dark woods alone, chasing her shadow. The wolf had pale yellow eyes and a black smile. He gulped her down whole. But the girl ate the wolf from inside his own belly. She ripped and chewed and swallowed until the beast was inside her belly instead, every last sharp tooth of him. She belched. She howled and barked at the moon.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You. You will whisper to the wolf inside you:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>You ought not have gone into the deep dark woods alone.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When my sisters and I were young, my dad used to sit one of us on his lap and thump on our back and chant â&#128;&#156;Hurley-burley, thumpety whack! Pretty good fellow, pretty good back! How many fingers do I hold up?â&#128;&#157; He would pause for us to guess a number, then resume the chant. â&#128;&#156;Two, she said, and three there were. Pretty good fellow to go to the war!â&#128;&#157;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nobody Iâ&#128;&#153;ve talked to knows where this rhyme comes fromâ&#128;&#148;maybe itâ&#128;&#153;s about sending child soldiers to war, or about the arbitrary nature of death. Often, those people tried to look Â at simple nursery rhymes and try to find dark or scary origins for them. But most nursery rhymes, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve found, werenâ&#128;&#153;t even created for childrenâ&#128;&#148;they were the jumbled together songs and poems that tired mothers brought into the nursery, searching for anything to soothe a crying child. In fact, most nursery rhymes probably donâ&#128;&#153;t mean anything, although one of the few that might have dark origins is â&#128;&#156;London Bridge is Falling Down.â&#128;&#157; Archeological evidence supports the claim that â&#128;&#156;London Bridgeâ&#128;&#157; is about human sacrificeâ&#128;&#148;specifically, the practice of burying children in the foundations of a bridge to keep it standing. Though there are no findings of human remains in the current-day London Bridge, other old bridges have been found with human remains. Many of us have played the childrenâ&#128;&#153;s game that goes with the songâ&#128;&#148;two kids form an arch with their arms which falls to catch one of the others passing underneath. Maybe that â&#128;&#156;caughtâ&#128;&#157; person represents the victim of superstitious bridge-builders of the past.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But does the fact that this familiar chant might be about child sacrifice mean I shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t tell it to my children one day? Or that I shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t pass down my fatherâ&#128;&#153;s rhyme? No, I think it means I should. Nobody knows what my fatherâ&#128;&#153;s untraceable chant or â&#128;&#156;London Bridgeâ&#128;&#157; or â&#128;&#156;Ring Around the Rosieâ&#128;&#157; are really about, but the world is still as dangerous a place as it was back then. We can make up our own stories as we go along, but the origins we give them today will be no better than the ones they might really have. Human nature hasnâ&#128;&#153;t improved over the centuries. Old stories about children with candles who were killed to protect an ancient bridge arenâ&#128;&#153;t fooling anyone that weâ&#128;&#153;re better off todayâ&#128;&#148;not even our kids.</p>
