# Tiny Donkey

This is a static version of the _Tiny Donkey_ website produced by the WP2Static Wordpress plugin.

_Tiny Donkey_ was a literary magazine, published between 2015 and 2017, that focused on short-form, fairy-tale nonfiction. It was an off-shoot of _Fairy Tale Review_, "an annual literary journal dedicated to publishing new fairy tales and to helping raise public awareness of fairy tales as a diverse, innovative art form."
