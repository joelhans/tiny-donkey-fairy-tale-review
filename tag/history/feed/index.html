								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">by Murad Jalilov<a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic.jpg"><br />
<img class="wp-image-908 alignright" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic-261x300.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="343" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic-261x300.jpg 261w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic.jpg 555w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Growing up Goychay, Azerbaijan, I would always hear my grandmother telling tales of old, some more interesting than others. She always told them at night in her loud-yet-soothing voice. The ones that stuck out the most were the fairy tales that were meant to frighten, such as “Adamcil” (Man-Eater), a tale of a humanoid with long horns and claws, covered in fur, eating human corpses, and “Isah and Musah,” the tale of a bird that mimics the cries of two brothers lost in a forest. These tales had a certain eerie charm to them and always blended with the mysterious nature and sounds of the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the better ways of introducing the public to a new culture is through folklore, more specifically fairy tales. As an immigrant from Azerbaijan, I’ve seen the current trends in American society where diversity is being somewhat celebrated, despite the current political rhetoric. It made me realize that I have something of my own to bring into this country and to its culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Azerbaijan’s geographical position as a country between the Middle East and Europe, surrounded by countries such as Russia, Iran and Turkey, made it an ancient hub for cultural exchange, creating a relatively unique folklore. The story that reflects this the most is “The Tale of Malikmammad,” about a young prince who journeys into the Dark World and has to face creatures from European folklore, like ogres and dragons, and a creature from Turkic folklore called the Emerald Bird (Zumrud/Konrul). There are also Azerbaijani versions of western tales such as “Cinderella” (“Göyçək Fatma”) and “The Three Goats” (“Şəngülüm, Şüngülüm, Məngülüm”). There are also plenty of tales about animals, usually with human traits, such as “Trickster Goat,” which tells the story of a goat that outsmarted a bear, a wolf, and a fox.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, a very limited number of Azerbaijani fairy tales have been translated into English, one of them being “Jirtan: The Little Boy Who Fought Monsters,” published in <em>Azerbaijan International Magazine</em> in 1996. Beyond this example, it is almost impossible to find English translations for fairy tales in the language, even for those that are known well among the Azerbaijani people, and it’s a shame that so much folklore is lost behind the language barrier. Fortunately, the age of information has connected people from around the world, making it much easier for cultures to share their heritage online for all to read and translate. Other than websites dedicated to collecting fairy tales and folklore, for me personally the web makes it easier to stay in touch with my relatives in Azerbaijan on a much more frequent basis, which allows me to ask them for fairytales that have never been recorded online or in print.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is essential that these fairy tales are translated into English and introduced to the wider public to add the voice of a culture that has been silent for years. Unfortunately, there is little interest in literarily translating Azerbaijani literature into English among those who speak both languages, and there are even fewer people versed in creative writing in English on a college level. Azerbaijani fairy tales will bring new ideas and enrich the literature that is available in English. For this reason, I have been inspired to add the cultural artifacts I brought with me, in the form of fairy tales, to the ever-growing melting pot that is the US, through literary translation.</p>
<p><em>Read Murad Jalilov and N.K. Valek&#8217;s translation of &#8220;The Trickster Goat&#8221; below.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-905"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Trickster Goat </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Translated by Murad Jalilov and N.K Valek</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once there was and once there wasn’t a group of people moving from the mountains to the plains. A Goat, a Calf, and a Sheep from the herds were in a hidden place eating grass and were not aware that their people were leaving them. When they raised their heads, however, their people were already gone. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Calf went to the Goat. “Brother Goat,” he cried, “the wolf is going to eat us! Please find us a way!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goat replied, “Let us find a hut and start living in it.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three of them agreed and started searching for a hut. Along the way, they found the pelt of a bear for the Calf, and pelt of wolf for the Goat and a pelt of fox for the Sheep to cover themselves with. After some more wandering, they finally found a hut and happily entered it, only to find a Bear, a Wolf, and a Fox having a chat.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bear spoke happily to the fox, “Grandfather Fox, please bring me a piece of wood.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fox brought a piece of wood from the corner. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bear put the wood on his chest and started singing, “Ring, my lute, ring: Today I ate a calf, and another fell down the chimney.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wolf took the wood from the Bear and sang, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a goat, and another one came to me willingly.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the Fox took the wood. “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a sheep and shall have another one!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing all this, the Goat told the Sheep, “Bring me a piece of wood.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sheep gave the Goat the piece of wood. The Goat put the wood on his chest and started singing, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a wolf, covered myself with its pelt, and I shall eat another one.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he gave the wood to the Calf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Calf took the wood and sang, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a bear, covered myself with its pelt, and I shall eat another one.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Calf gave the wood to the Sheep, who also sang, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a fox, covered myself with its pelt, and I shall eat another one.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Fox heard this, it ran out the hut, followed by the Wolf and the Bear. The Goat told his comrades, “This trick saved our lives. They will have time to think while they run and they will return to eat us. Let’s run somewhere else.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them agreed to leave. They wandered for a little, and they stumbled upon a rock. They decided to climb the rock and lie down there. Meanwhile the Bear, the Wolf and the Fox were still running. Suddenly the Wolf spoke up, “Hey, a goat, a calf and a sheep won’t be able to eat us. They tricked us. Let’s go back and eat them.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they returned to the hut, they found it to be abandoned. They followed the track of the three animals and stumbled upon a rock. They saw the Goat, the Calf and the Sheep on top of the rock. Once the Calf noticed the Bear’s scary gaze, he got frightened, slipped and fell from the rock. The Goat seeing this yelled as loud as he could:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Brother Calf, go get the bear, and we’ll take care of the wolf and the fox!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing this, the Fox ran off, and the Wolf and the Bear followed. The three herd friends laughed for a while together. Later all three of them found a way to the plains and rejoined the herds of their people. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Girls_playing_London_Bridge_1898.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-494" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Girls_playing_London_Bridge_1898.jpg" alt="girls_playing_london_bridge_1898" width="1181" height="842" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Girls_playing_London_Bridge_1898.jpg 1181w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Girls_playing_London_Bridge_1898-300x214.jpg 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Girls_playing_London_Bridge_1898-768x548.jpg 768w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Girls_playing_London_Bridge_1898-1024x730.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1181px) 100vw, 1181px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When my sisters and I were young, my dad used to sit one of us on his lap and thump on our back and chant “Hurley-burley, thumpety whack! Pretty good fellow, pretty good back! How many fingers do I hold up?” He would pause for us to guess a number, then resume the chant. “Two, she said, and three there were. Pretty good fellow to go to the war!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nobody I’ve talked to knows where this rhyme comes from—maybe it’s about sending child soldiers to war, or about the arbitrary nature of death. Often, those people tried to look  at simple nursery rhymes and try to find dark or scary origins for them. But most nursery rhymes, I’ve found, weren’t even created for children—they were the jumbled together songs and poems that tired mothers brought into the nursery, searching for anything to soothe a crying child. In fact, most nursery rhymes probably don’t mean anything, although one of the few that might have dark origins is “London Bridge is Falling Down.” Archeological evidence supports the claim that “London Bridge” is about human sacrifice—specifically, the practice of burying children in the foundations of a bridge to keep it standing. Though there are no findings of human remains in the current-day London Bridge, other old bridges have been found with human remains. Many of us have played the children’s game that goes with the song—two kids form an arch with their arms which falls to catch one of the others passing underneath. Maybe that “caught” person represents the victim of superstitious bridge-builders of the past.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But does the fact that this familiar chant might be about child sacrifice mean I shouldn’t tell it to my children one day? Or that I shouldn’t pass down my father’s rhyme? No, I think it means I should. Nobody knows what my father’s untraceable chant or “London Bridge” or “Ring Around the Rosie” are really about, but the world is still as dangerous a place as it was back then. We can make up our own stories as we go along, but the origins we give them today will be no better than the ones they might really have. Human nature hasn’t improved over the centuries. Old stories about children with candles who were killed to protect an ancient bridge aren’t fooling anyone that we’re better off today—not even our kids.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Dodge Ram scrambles over rocks and rain-hewn ditches; water gallons and bean cans jostle  in the truck bed. I gaze out the window, stretch my pointer fingers and thumbs then hold my hands catty-corner to pretend I’m making postcards. <em>Snap!</em>—everything gold, gilded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sinking-sun landscape looks like one of those photo essays from <em>Arizona Highways</em> I leaf through in the library. The Altar Valley is amber with cholla and prickly pear, acacia and mesquite trees. The dusk casts miniature, scattered mountain ranges in vermilions and mauves. Baboquivari’s cuspate peak stands sentinel above it all, so backlit that it looks like its cut out of black construction paper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Golden hour is seductive enough to lure me towards forgetting. I pull myself back, remind myself that the recent history of this desert is a catalogue of predacious desire for <em>aurum</em>, Au, the metal that shines like the sun:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;">1540: Coronado (arrogant, silver-plated) searches the Southwest for Cíbola, the legendary city of gold. He finds no such city but still plunders towns and villages, leaving death and destruction in his Spanish wake.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;">Pima County, 1774: Manuel Lopez, a Spanish holy man, forces a group of Tohono O’odham to extract gold from the Quijotoa Mountains. Thus begins gold mining in Arizona.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;">1877: White settlers open the Montana Mine in Ruby, Arizona. Until 1940, when it’s abandoned, residents extract gold, silver, lead, zinc, and copper from the mine.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;">(Ruby is now <em>one of the two best-preserved mining ghost towns in Arizona</em> according to Wikipedia, twenty-five-odd buildings scattered on a hillside below the gaping mine mouth. The mine is home to thousands of Mexican free-tailed bats that swirl into the darkening summer sky, going north-south-east-west in search of bugs, disregarding the nearby cattle fence that splits two countries like a wound.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then there’s my own white, middle-class childhood. 1994: I’m five, in a pink-painted bedroom just north of New York City, thousands of miles from this dusty border. My father reads to me from <em>My First Book of Fairy Tales</em>. The illustrations are full of golden objects&#8211;the giant’s eggs in “Jack and the Beanstalk,” Cinderella’s pumpkin coach. After he finishes a story, my father asks, “What’s the golden rule?” and I respond, well taught, “He who has the gold makes the rules.” It’s his favorite punchline. We laugh, oblivious to how it implicates us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The princesses in the volume have locks so burnished they seem incendiary&#8211;like they might, at any moment, burst into flame.</p>

<p><em>I lived in Appalachia for four years, and it&#8217;s there that I encountered&#8211;and fell in love with&#8211;Appalachian ballad singing. Sparse and haunting, ballads are usually sung without instrumentation and tell melancholy tales of betrayal and lost love. Many draw on traditional literature&#8211;like folklore and fairy tales&#8211;and the medieval romance tradition. I wanted to know more, so I asked my friend <a href="http://www.sarosings.com/">Saro Lynch-Thomason</a>, a folklorist and ballad singer, a few questions.</em></p>
<p><em>Lynch-Thomason&#8211;who is based in Asheville, North Carolina&#8211;is also an illustrator, author, and social activist. In 2012 she completed </em><a href="http://www.blairpathways.com/">Blair Pathways: A Musical Exploration of America’s Largest Labor Uprising</a><em>&#8211;a researched compilation of over 20 historic songs from West Virginia’s labor wars. Saro has led the Asheville Community Sing since 2010 and regularly teaches regional ballad workshops, Wassailing choruses, and May Day choruses on social justice themes. In 2013, Saro completed her solo CD </em><a href="https://sarolyncht.bandcamp.com/album/vessel">Vessel</a><em>&#8211;an acappella compilation of ballads and songs from Appalachia and the British Isles. Her distinct, powerful singing style transports audiences to Appalachian mountain hollers, 19th-century coal camps and old meeting houses.</em></p>
<p>(As a heads up, this interview mentions sexual assault.)</p>
<p><strong>Ballad singing traveled from the British Isles to Appalachia, where you live. Can you tell me a little bit about ballad singing, how it originated and how it ended up in the U.S. Mountain South?</strong></p>
<p>Ballads as they are often referred to today reference a particular story-song form that has been in Europe for nearly 1,000 years. Often a ballad involves first or third person narration, a simple rhyme scheme and a repeated melody. In the 1100s and 1200s, this form of storytelling was popular across what is modern-day France and Spain. A class of minstrels, supported by nobility, traveled and composed poetry and songs in this format. Over 2,000 poems have survived from this period, along with hundreds of melodies.</p>
<p>Since then there have been several periods of songwriting popularity, during which everyone from nobles to peasants took an interest in creating and singing their own ballads. Many ballads were written in the Middle Ages, about 300 of which survive today. But many ballads come from a revival period that began in the 1600s and had its heyday with the creation of the letterpress. People wrote and dispersed songs across Europe and America, drawing on old melodies and themes but with updated characters and political messaging.</p>
<p>During this period many ballads came to America, brought by immigrants from England, Ireland, and Scotland who arrived throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Immigrants families carried and adapted these songs for generations as they worked and settled across the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, the Piedmont in North Carolina, and the Appalachian Mountains. These song styles became dispersed into Afro-Appalachian communities as well, where people continued to change them.</p>

<p><strong>How did you become interested in ballads? What has your journey studying, singing and teaching ballads been like?</strong></p>
<p>Growing up in Nashville, TN, my parents played music from the British folk revival of the 60s and 70s alongside contemporary composers who drew from traditional sources&#8211;singers like Sinead O’Connor and Loreena McKennitt. I latched on to the ballads I heard and spent time by myself memorizing them. In addition, my aunts had learned many ballads in the folk revival era, and taught me songs from their repertoire.</p>
<p>When I attended college in the Northeast I met other people my age who studied and sang ballads. Having peers who were just as interested in these songs as I was encouraged me to learn more. After school I moved to Western North Carolina to connect with the many traditional singing communities there, and I’ve been studying ballads ever since.</p>
<p>The process of hearing a ballad, learning it, and teaching it has always felt very emotional and spiritual to me. Knowing that a song has been carried from body to body for generations is a powerful thing. A song has to really resonate with many people in order for it to be passed and remembered and cherished for long periods of time. When I sing a ballad, I feel like I’m not only inheriting the song but the community of people who have sung it. I have an invisible circle of folks who affirm my feelings and connection to the song’s content. Getting to teach these songs to others, and learning what the stories mean to them, is a rewarding and revelatory experience.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of stories do ballads tell? How do ballads relate to traditional forms of literature, like folk and fairy tales?</strong></p>
<p>Ballads can tell just about every kind of story. They’ve been used to spread news, to teach moral lessons, as political propaganda, as escapist fantasies, and as fatalistic laments. Since these story songs have been around since at least the 1100s, it’s impossible to generalize what they tell about. Different eras do seem to have had favored themes, though. In America, for example, popular ballad themes have included murders (often based on real events), cowboy tales, betrayed love, and train wrecks. In the 1600s and 1700s in England many ballads detailed the dramas of the nobility (sort of like modern-day tabloids), lamented sailors’ deaths at sea, and celebrated famous battles.</p>
<p>For as long as these songs have been around they’ve enjoyed a close relationship with literature. Starting in the same period that medieval minstrelsy was popular across Europe&#8211;the 1100s&#8211; there was a literary form popular among nobility called romance writing. Nobles and aristocracy would write stories inspired by legends and older histories, using prose and verse forms. Over time people truncated these stories, added a tune, and started singing them. In turn, these ballads could eventually inspire new poetry or novels.</p>
<p>A great example of the interweaving of literary and musical storytelling can be seen in the Thomas of Erceldoune legend. Thomas of Erceldoune was a Scottish lord in the 1200s. According to legend, he was a seer and prophet, and is also credited with writing the English version of the romance “Tristram and Isolde”- a precursor to the Lancelot and Guinevere legend. Erceldoune passed away in the late 1200s, and about one hundred years later someone decided to write a romance praising his abilities. The narrative is written from Thomas’ perspective, and explains that he received his gifts of prophecy from a fairy queen. By the 1700s, this romance had become a ballad. The first verse of many versions says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">True Thomas lay on Huntlie bank,<br />
A ferlie he spied wi’ his ee,<br />
And there he saw a lady bright,<br />
Come riding down by the Eildon Tree.</p>
<p>Thomas spies a “ferlie” with his “ee,” or “eye. In the Scots language a “ferlie” is a “wonder,” in this case the wondrous site of the fairy queen approaching Thomas to take him to her realm.</p>
<p>During the same period this song was popular, a literary ballad revival was taking place in Europe. Aristocratic scholars and writers began to collect and study ballads, using them as inspiration for poetry. One of these artists, Sir Walter Scott, collected the Thomas ballad and wrote his own third part to the narrative, extending the story and reviving interest in the singing of the ballad.</p>
<p>The song seems to have made its way to America, and was written down in the mid-1900s from a version sung by a woman named Becky Gordon in Western North Carolina. Her first verse reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">True Thomas lay on yonder hill<br />
And saw a lady gay<br />
A lady that was bright and fair<br />
Come riding down the way</p>
<p>I found this ballad in a collection of North Carolina folklore and added my own tune since it had none. I’ve been singing it for a few years now. To me, it’s a “ferlie” that a story like True Thomas has been around for so long, and I think its survival and popularity is due to the fact that it has taken literary forms many times.</p>
<p>Some people argue that if a ballad is written down, it begins to die&#8211;that putting the narrative to paper means people will stop knowing it and holding it in their minds and memory. I think the history of Thomas of Erceldoune demonstrates that the relationship between written stories and sung stories is natural and mutually beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>You’re interested in the sociopolitical dimensions of ballad singing. How does your work with ballads – as well as the ballads themselves&#8211; relate to issues like feminism, economic justice, and environmental destruction in Appalachia?</strong></p>
<p>Ballads have a powerful political dimension to them&#8211;they can be used to push against cultural expectations or to affirm them. Which meaning a ballad has is often up to the interpretation of the singers and listeners.</p>
<p>I’ve been teaching workshops for a while that focus on women’s experiences in ballads. Some of the stories in ballads are about the hardest experiences women go through&#8211;like economic disenfranchisement, abortion and sexual assault. In some ballads women face these challenges and find creative solutions to overcome them, and in others they simply have to bear the weight of these traumas. In my workshops, I’ve been exploring how these kinds of stories can be viewed as empowering in the right context. For example, a song that I’ve enjoyed singing to myself for years is called simply “Queen Jane.” The ballad is about a rape, and I’ve sung it to myself, alone, countless times as a way to emotionally process my experiences of sexual assault. It’s such an intense song that I would have trouble hearing or sharing it in a public space, but the solitary practice of singing it has been a great comfort to me. Whoever originally wrote “Queen Jane” may not have had that use in mind for the song, but that’s how ballads work&#8211;the songs survive because they take on personal meanings to people. This use of ballads as processing tools for traumatic experiences is profound and moving to me as a feminist and activist.</p>
<p>As an organizer in Appalachia, I’ve enjoyed using ballads as overtly political statements. A lot of European songs from hundreds of years ago speak to the same issues Appalachians are facing today, including <a href="http://content.sierraclub.org/coal/mining-destroying-mountains">environmental destruction </a>and lack of access to land. English ballads about the enclosure of the commons could easily describe <a href="http://auroralights.org/map_project/theme.php?theme=coal_river_101&amp;article=14">the modern state of private land ownership</a> in Appalachia. Some of these older songs also tell about rebellions and land reclamation movements, suggesting strategies that could be used today.</p>
<p>One of my favorite political ballads is an adaptation of an English song called &#8220;The Cutty Wren.” The song is thought to have originally been a coded rebel song about killing the king and dispersing his riches. One of the characters in the song declares, “We’ll shoot the cutty wren!” &#8212; the wren being a longtime symbol of kings and rulers. In the new version, adapted by ballad singer and Appalachian activist Michael Kline, the song details the plans of a group of people to blow up a bulldozer on a strip site. The same character declares, “We’ll blow the big dozer!”</p>
<p>Appalachians have taken older songs like this and countless times adapted them to their own struggles. Like all ballad singing, whether the song ends sadly or hopefully it serves the purpose of connecting many generations and helping the singer move through their own struggles. It’s an empowering and affirming tool that I hope continues for at least another thousand years.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Biologists reconstruct the descent histories of life forms on planet Earth as the <i>tree of life</i>, its dense trunks and branches leading from common ancestors to new species. Such phylogenetic relationships are not limited to biology. Sara Graça da Silva and Jamshid J. Tehrani from the New University of Lisbon in Portugal applied the same analysis tools and techniques to storytelling.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>  Using the catalogue of categorized written folklore in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther (ATU) Index, they &#8220;recorded the presence/absence of each [of] these tales [&#8230;] in 50 Indo-European-speaking populations represented in the ATU Index&#8221; and traced along the resulting tree-like descent histories how these stories were transmitted.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[2]</a></p>
<p>The vertically-transmitted story is passed down within a culture through cultural inheritance. After migration and time, the story might show up around the world, told in daughter languages that emerged out of the original language in which it was first told. A horizontally-transmitted story leaps across cultural and language boundaries to reach foreign audiences. Graça da Silva and Tehrani found evidence for stronger vertical than horizontal transmissions for many of the folk tales they studied. When &#8220;accounting for spatial relationships among linguistically related Indo-European groups,&#8221; many folktales seemed to have been rejected by adjacent cultures. Rejection by foreign cultures and missed opportunities to translate and adopt such stories that might have changed them significantly helped them to retain much of their original form.</p>
<p>Graça da Silva and Tehrani traced this remarkable retention of the basic story arc across hundreds and thousands of years and miles to glimpse—for a few stories—ancient origins in the oral traditions. They discovered that &#8220;The Smith and the Devil&#8221; fairy tale might have originated over 6000 years ago in the Bronze Age. Preserved in the phylogenetic relationships are ancient moments of telling: a blacksmith and their fictional story about the struggle to smelt copper and alloy, or other community members and their fictional stories about the blacksmith. After all, to pursue craft is isolating; to pursue work with metals is magical, powerful, dangerous, and thus perfect for gossip and exclusion and storytelling.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[3]</a></p>
<p>Certainly the Devil is involved.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[4]</a> There&#8217;s the bargain—the smith&#8217;s soul for mastery over the new dark arts—and there&#8217;s the twist—the morally questionable smith beats the Devil at his own game—and there&#8217;s the implication that art, craft, technology, knowledge itself are both divine and damning. From roots to branches, it&#8217;s an implication that susurrates thousands of years later.</p>

<p>Biddy Early peered down a bottle’s neck to see the future. One wonders if she ever saw Lady Gregory coming decades down the road, gossiping with Biddy’s old neighbors, collecting astonishing tales about this wise healer woman of western Ireland. Biddy Early was already legendary before she died—accused of witchcraft once, eternally at odds with the local priests, married four times over. She didn’t need Lady Gregory to make her famous-slash-infamous, or whatever the liminal space is where wise women dwell.</p>
<p>But Gregory needed Early. Her name lent authenticity to the cast of banshees, blacksmiths, and other characters in Gregory’s folklore collection <em>Visions and Beliefs in the West of Ireland</em> (1920). And her neighbors’ trusting chattiness about their own peasant practices and beliefs eased Gregory’s aristocratic guilt.</p>
<p>Both women were western Irish—Early born Bridget Connors in County Clare in 1798, Gregory born Isabella Augusta Persse in County Galway in 1852. Early was born the year of an uprising in Ireland against British rule—a fitting start for a figure of female rebellion. Gregory came into the world at the end of the Great Potato Famine, a time when 1 million Irish died by fever or starvation. She grew up only 25 miles from Early’s humble cottage, but she was a member of the gentry, an Anglo-Irish Protestant not only protected from the ravages of the Famine but a benefactor. The man she married, Sir William Gregory, was a member of Parliament with a Galway estate called Coole Park—a place of lakes, limestone, woods and wild swans. At the height of the Famine, Sir William drafted a clause in the Poor Relief Laws that led to the eviction of thousands of peasants in the west. These were among Ireland’s poorest population, the ones who suffered the Famine’s worst destitution, the most deaths. And the strongest bearers of the old Gaelic folkways and language. Biddy’s people. With their decimation, would Ireland’s folk culture follow?</p>
<p>Early survived the Famine, dying around 1872 with a priest’s blessing in exchange for breaking her magic bottle. Lady Gregory was widowed in 1892. Within a year she was immersing herself in the Irish language and folk culture and soon professing Irish nationalism. She sometimes paid her peasant storytellers small tokens for their memories—but never stopped collecting their rents.</p>
<p>Maybe Biddy’s chatty neighbors did trust Lady Gregory. Or maybe they were simply squaring another uneven exchange with a landholder—embellishing their barter by telling tall tales. Perhaps Biddy Early also managed to square an uneven barter. Maybe those glass shards beside the blessed deathbed belonged to a decoy bottle.</p>
