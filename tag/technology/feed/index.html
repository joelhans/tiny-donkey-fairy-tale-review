<p style="text-align: justify;">I picture my mother at the helm of a boat somewhere in the thick of ocean. Floating behind the boat is a glacier, a compression of quiet grace. My mother has tied a thousand ancient ropes to the glacier and is pulling it through the water with the same conviction that I imagine Moses had when he parted the sea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-534" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-1024x681.jpg" alt="16286584359_778ff002ed_k" width="660" height="439" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-300x199.jpg 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-768x510.jpg 768w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For years, she has whispered her plan to us. Before they all melt, my mother wants to transport a glacier from Alaska to wherever my sister and I are living, so that we will have a secure source of water. To keep it from melting, she will coat the glacier in sawdust, as if sprinkling confectioner&#8217;s sugar on a slice of bundt cake. Then, she will chain it to a tugboat and tow it across the ocean, where it will finally be left in a dry pond or a desert&#8217;s scorched riverbed so that my sister and I will not die of thirst. We have always rolled our eyes to this idea. <em>Impossible,</em> we&#8217;ve said. But, recently, I&#8217;ve wondered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the night of her seventieth birthday, my mother told my sister and I that some scientists believe the moon was once part of the earth. This theory surmises that when the moon separated from the earth, the Pacific Ocean was formed in its void. We were eating pineapple-upside-down cake in the flicker of candlelight, she was wearing a white kimono and a halo made from fourteen carmine flowers, and my sister and I balked at the idea. But my mother insisted until my sister googled it. <em>It&#8217;s called the fission hypothesis,</em> my sister says. <em>I guess I have to get a PhD,</em> my mother responded with a tilt of her halo,<em> for people to listen to me.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over a decade ago, my mother had a theory that the energy from the moving bodies at gyms or playgrounds could be used for electricity. When she and I walked past fitness centers with treadmills in the windows, she pointed to the sweating bodies and said,<em> Imagine how many light bulbs they could be powering?</em> My eyes went from the runners&#8217; wet, mangled hair to the ceiling, where fluorescent lights hummed incessantly above their heads, but I wasn&#8217;t convinced. Years later, my sister saw an advertisement: a company was utilizing the velocity of playing children to power electrical outlets in a playground.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maybe I’m wrong to not believe that you can part the sea, that a body can run enough to flash on a light bulb, that the moon can slice itself from the earth and spiral out into the knitted black of the sky. Maybe I am wrong to not picture the glacier, hulking and glossy, rising over the sea like a skyscraper; to not look closely at this image until I can see my mother&#8217;s reflection in the ice, waving at the distant sight of land, her salty seaweed hair swept into the sea-wind, rough waves smacking against the sides of the boat. If I look even closer, I will discern on my mother&#8217;s face not only the knowledge that her family&#8217;s thirst will forever be quenched, but also that now, after all these years, they will maybe, finally, believe her.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locations are connected by wormholes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask Neil Postman, media theorist. As early as the 19th century, new communications technology and mass media collapsed the space between local and distant. Postman writes that after news from Washington, D.C. made its way to Baltimore along the first telegraph lines on May 25, 1844 to be printed in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baltimore Patriot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that same afternoon, &#8220;The paper concluded its report by noting: &#8216;&#8230;we are thus enabled to give our readers information from Washington up to two o&#8217;clock. This is indeed the annihilation of space.'&#8221;[1]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask Amber Case, cyber anthropologist. She explains the concept of a wormhole by telling about how her father taught her the shortest distance between two points on a piece of paper is only a straight line if she ignored how the paper could be folded so that the two points touched.[2] While writing her anthropology thesis on cellphones, she &#8220;realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">They weren&#8217;t physically transporting themselves;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">they were mentally transporting themselves.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">They would click on a button,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and they would be connected as A to B immediately.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Ask your magic mirror, that display you hang on the wall, hold in your hand, or hide your eyes behind. At your command, your TV, computer, gaming console, smartphone, tablet, heads-up display, and virtual reality gear mirror your mind, your voice, your avatar, and, eventually, a wholly-immersed you through wormholes that remap location and body instantaneously to the hybrid realities—destinations where the analog and physical real world merges with or vanishes into digital and virtual new worlds. These places are not limited to their sights and sounds but will soon engage every sense. With emerging technologies surrounding your person, upon your person, within your person, your skin is a new skin, like your tongue, like your nose and ears and eyes. In so many new worlds to explore with your wormhole-enhanced cyborg physiology, you may find a home, or the horror of an endless virtual. At every destination on every wall there will wait a magic mirror, this hall of mirrors, this labyrinth in which you arrive so easily but cannot be certain that you arrived where you wanted to go.</p>

<p>What must a boy lose to become a little bird? In “The Juniper Tree,” by the Brothers Grimm, the boy loses more than just his head and his life after he is murdered by his evil stepmother. All that fat and skin and tissue sliced up, made into stew, fed to his oblivious father. All that bone wrapped up in a silk scarf and deposited under the juniper tree by his grieving half-sister. Then the tree works its magic and the dead boy is transformed into a living bird, a singing bird, a busy bird, a vengeful bird. He is without human arms, hands, and fingers now that they are wings. His legs are tiny and his feet are missing toes. His bones are hollow and light. His lips are rigid beaks.</p>
<p>People lose huge chunks of self—limbs, organs, functionality, quality of life—to disease and trauma every day. The survivors learn to fly and sing in their remaining bodies. They rise and fall and rise again with new routines and augmentations. They do not, however, receive for their efforts the bird’s reward at the end of the fairy tale: upon crushing his stepmother with a millstone, he immediately transforms back into the living boy he once was.</p>
<p>Transformative rewards may be coming, though. Recent medical breakthroughs promise to give back what survivors have lost: 3D-printed windpipes and other organs infused with the patient’s own cells. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> Thought-controlled prosthetics. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[2]</a> Face transplants. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[3]</a> Rewritten genetic code to prevent and treat genetic diseases. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[4]</a> These and other emerging technologies arrive and improve so rapidly that we have to wonder where all of this is heading. For a few years yet, these technologies will only approximate what survivors have lost, but there may soon come a time when technology returns full functionality to the human body and imbues it with better-than-human capabilities and performance.</p>
<p>After a terrible accident, the protagonist in Sunny Moraine’s recent short story, “Love Letters to Things Lost and Gained,” grapples with a cutting-edge prosthetic arm, an arm that provides enhancements and capabilities the original did not have, an arm that may be sentient, an arm that may be seeking friendship. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[5]</a> When a medical breakthrough arrives that fully regrows lost biological limbs, the protagonist ponders the question “The Juniper Tree” never thought to ask: What must the little bird lose to become the boy again?</p>
