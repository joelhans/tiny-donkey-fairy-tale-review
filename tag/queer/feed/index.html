								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>by Psyche Z. Ready</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have always loved stories of cross-dressing heroines. It’s a familiar trope in literature, legends, and fairy tales: a woman dresses as a man to solve some problem, or to save the day. In her male guise, she is strong, brave, skillful, and clever.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> At the end of the tale, however, when the conflict is resolved, she usually puts back on her apron and returns home. In many variants, home is a controlling father, a bullying brother, or a drunken husband. In my search for variants, I found another tale type that ends differently. In “The Shift of Sex,” or ATU 514<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[2]</a> , the heroine does not go home after her adventures, but stays in her male disguise and eventually <i>becomes </i>a man. Most variants follow this narrative (I’ve used the gendered pronouns given in most sources):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>An elderly father is asked by the king to enter military service. Because he is old and has no sons, his daughter dresses in his clothes, borrows his horse, and joins for him. With the help of her magical horse, she excels at all she does. She quickly becomes the king’s favorite soldier, and his daughter falls in love with her. When the community begins to doubt that she is a man, they set her on impossible quests that she completes easily. Her final battle is with a demon or witch, who curses her with their dying breath: “If you are a man, be now a woman! If you are a woman, be now a man.” The hero returns home to his castle where he is celebrated, his wife rejoices, and they all live happily ever after.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Shift of Sex” is a very old and widespread tale: it has been told for at least two, possibly three thousand years<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[3]</a> , across Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas. There are at least twenty-six variants in English today, and I have spent the last year researching them. In <a href="http://mars.gmu.edu/bitstream/handle/1920/10314/Ready_thesis_2016.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">my academic work</a> on the subject, I argue that this tale type was historically a space to express frustrations at the limitations of the female gender. Today, however, this tale has the potential to hold space for a broader expression of gender identity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-784 aligncenter" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2.jpg" alt="" width="407" height="479" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2.jpg 522w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2-255x300.jpg 255w" sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An issue that some modern readers have with this tale is that, while it begins as a queer romance between two women, it ends with what feels like a return to heteronormativity. When the protagonist changes gender, the couple becomes heterosexual. Some readers interpret the story as a narrative message that says a happy ending for two women in love is impossible. The story is read as a <i>condemnation</i> of queer love. I read this story, however, not as a queer romance gone hetero, but as a trans love story with a happy ending. I would not argue that audiences thousands of years ago saw the protagonist in this tale as transgender<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[4]</a>, but present-day audiences certainly can.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the many variants of this tale type, there are differences in narrative structure, tone, and detail, but the one element that is present in each is the happy ending: the princess is overjoyed that her partner has changed gender, and she and the royal family accept him, and they live happily ever after. Historically, our literary and popular narratives are lousy with stories of characters who transgress gender roles or heteronormativity and suffer for it; even contemporary stories with queer and non-binary characters <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays">kill them off</a>, or <a href="http://www.glaad.org/publications/victims-or-villains-examining-ten-years-transgender-images-television">depict them as monsters</a>. The message spoken by these narratives is clear: any transgression of traditional gender and sexuality will be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While we as a culture continue the struggle to create happy endings for transgressive and transgender characters in our own popular literature, we can take heart that there is a folktale that has been told and retold for thousands of years with a transgressive, cross-dressing, sex-changing protagonist who is not punished, but rewarded for their bravery, skill, and strength with wealth, marriage, and a happy life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by Sonya Vatomsky</em></p>
<p><strong>A note for readers: this essay mentions sexual violence.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff.jpg"><img class="wp-image-576 alignright" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff-215x300.jpg" alt="bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff" width="313" height="437" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff-215x300.jpg 215w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /></a>In folklore, the term “transformation chase” refers to the use of shapeshifting as a means of combat or escape. The wizard duel in the animated film <em>The Sword In The Stone</em>, for one, but more traditionally the plot of several Celtic ballads. &#8220;The Ballad of Tam-Lin&#8221; was included in a book of folktales I had as a child, translated from song to prose. I remember loving it. I remember the way the name “Tam-Lin” felt on my Russian tongue, liquid and strong. For those unfamiliar with the story, it goes like this: a girl comes upon Tam-Lin in the woods of Carterhaugh, where he is being held prisoner by the Queen of Fairies. To rescue him from the Queen and win him as a lover, the girl must hold him fast through countless transformations: a roaring lion, a terrifying snake, the painful scald of flame. To my young sensibilities, this seemed extremely romantic. I appreciated the ritual of endurance; trials and pageantry were a necessity of love stories because some outside force willed it, not because of the lovers themselves. Years later, &#8220;The Ballad of Tam-Lin&#8221; made me pissed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Granted, what sounds romantic to a four-year-old-girl can hardly be expected to ring true to a thirty-year-old non binary queer person. All the same, I wanted to slice apart this story with my feminist lance — which is like a feminist lens, but for folktales. The basic premise of &#8220;Tam-Lin,&#8221; where a woman holds a man as he hurts her, was no longer abstract but a common narrative played out through a million books and films fetishizing a woman’s abnegation and self-sacrifice for the sake of a man’s potential. &#8220;Tam-Lin&#8221; became our culture’s unfortunate connection between pain and love, equating the latter with a willingness to suffer on behalf of another. “It’s only true if you bruise by the force of it,” as Chris Corner once said. Fuck. What had originally drawn me to such a sexist, heteronormative depiction of devotion? A poem from my poetry collection,<em> Salt Is For Curing</em>, tried to understand: “She holds and she hurts and / she wins. Maybe I liked it because the woman / is doing something, not waiting. It&#8217;s always / either waiting or hurting, you know, and often / one can’t tell the difference.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet the more I thought about it, the more &#8220;The Ballad of Tam-Lin&#8221; seemed itself to change shape, to become something other than what I had previously seen. As I looked back on an extremely difficult period of my life when I frequently lashed out in anger and attempted to isolate myself from those around me — and as I thought about the people who remained by my side throughout this — I began to see &#8220;Tam-Lin&#8221; not as a patriarchal narrative of pain-acceptance but as one where a character holds another through change. Tam-Lin did not become a flame and slowly burn hotter; he shifted indiscriminately, the changes done to him as he assumed monstrous forms akin to those in body-horror films like <em>The Fly</em> or <em>Tusk</em>. The transformation chase in &#8220;Tam-Lin&#8221; is a battle against the Fairy Queen and not really between the two individuals. In this forest, the courage required in love is made literal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be forcibly changed, especially as a means of achieving freedom, is a strong metaphor that does double-duty here: the girl can leave the forest and head home any time, but enduring the transformations is the only way for Tam-Lin to escape the Fairy Queen. Someone we love can certainly assume different shapes to frighten or hurt us, but the experiences that make us shift and change are as varied as all the animals in the wood of Carterhaugh. Which is to say: is it possible that there is something beautiful in love’s tenacity? Not in the sense that it’s good or admirable to endure pain, but in the sense that a transformation chase represents the monstrous qualities people display as they pass through tragedy — the qualities we might take on during the processing of grief or trauma. This link of change with pain, especially in the context of external pain (vis-à-vis the Fairy Queen), is in some ways a very honest look at any long-term relationship, where we must each see the other’s wounds and mold each other back into, if not our perfect form, then at least something passable. A transformation chase is not discomfort for the sake of another but the choice to remain by their side in a moment of shared discomfort — because, after all, it is only in fairy tales that change can happen with something as easy as a kiss.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>In 2014, when I began studying fairy tales, I came across Pauline Greenhill&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/41388863?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">&#8220;&#8216;Fitcher&#8217;s [Queer] Bird&#8217;: A Fairy-Tale Heroine and Her Avatars,&#8221;</a>  an academic article that offers a queer reading of <a href="http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/bluebeard/stories/fitchersbird.html">&#8220;Fitcher&#8217;s Bird,&#8221;</a> my favorite Grimm fairy tale. The article has deeply influenced my thinking and writing on fairy tales and so I was thrilled when, after sending off an email to Greenhill, she agreed to an interview.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Greenhill is Professor of Women’s and Gender Studies at the University of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Her most recent book is </em>Screening Justice: Canadian Crime Films, Culture and Society<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> which was co-edited with Steven Kohm and Sonia Bookman, and published in 2016.

She has fairy-tale research published in </em>Feral Feminisms; Law, Culture and the Humanities; Marvels &amp; Tales; Narrative Culture; Studies in European Cinema; <em>and </em>Theoretical Criminology<em> among others.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>There&#8217;s a storied tradition of studying fairy tales through a feminist lens, but you take that work further, examining queerness in fairy tales. How did you find your way into this field of research?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Absolutely my queer/trans research is an extension of my feminist research! But my route to queer and trans fairy tales was circuitous. I started a masters in Folklore at Memorial University in St. John’s, Newfoundland in 1977. At the time, and to a sad extent now, the cool kids avoided traditionally recognised forms of folklore like ballads and fairy tales. Trying to be one of them, I did my masters thesis on family photography.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, when I got to the University of Texas at Austin in 1981, where I did my PhD, I worked with Roger deV. Renwick, a ballad and folk song scholar who has always been an advocate for studying traditional genres (see e.g. Renwick 1980 and 2009). So for my PhD dissertation on folk poetry in Ontario under Roger’s supervision, I was looking for the old in the new, as it were (Greenhill 1989).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After five years teaching Canadian Studies at the University of Waterloo, I came to the University of Winnipeg’s (then) Women’s Studies program in 1991. (We’re now a Department with six full time faculty and we’ve included “and Gender.”) At the time I was working on Newfoundland ballads about women who dress as men to follow their lovers or seek adventure as sailors, soldiers, or robbers. You can listen to one example <a href="http://tidido.com/a35184374041547/al55f091c6a5f39075733cc084/t55f091c7a5f39075733cc127">here</a>, sung by the fabulous Newfoundland traditional source singer Anita Best on the compilation album <i>Bristol’s Hope&#8211;Lately Come Over</i>. Hitherto folklorists’ readings assumed that these songs were about men and their experiences, and my feminist reading asserted that they were also about women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-540"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, when I talked to my undergraduate feminist theory class, telling them my idea that these songs expressed possibilities for women to control their own libidinal and reproductive economy (that is, to choose their own sex partners/husbands rather than having the partner chosen by their father as is most common in ballads), the students pointed out alternatives to my heteronormative interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Specifically, I didn’t take into account the fact that these songs often circled around the drama of a man declaring love for and/or suggesting sex with the cross dresser, apparently thinking she was male; or a woman declaring love and/or suggesting sex, unaware that she was attracted to a woman. Following the students’ lead, my first queering of traditional culture ventured that these ballads were (also) about same-sex attraction (Greenhill 1995). I have since continued to queer, and later to explore transgender expression in, traditional ballads (Greenhill 2014).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fairy tales entered the mix when I invited my friend, colleague, and co-conspirator in feminist and queer folklore Kay Turner to teach an intensive feminist folklore course at the University of Winnipeg in 1997. Kay decided to offer a few classes on the Grimms’ fairy tales, and again our fabulous Women’s Studies students were influential! They read the stories anew, reflecting upon them from their own queer locations. Kay and I were fascinated and resolved to do a book incorporating these interpretations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Transgressive Tales: Queering the Grimms </i>(Turner and Greenhill 2012) was 15 years in the making. Part of the problem was the difficulty of finding folklorists in the late 1990s who were willing to venture a queer reading of traditional fairy tales! Then, just as we were getting ready to finalise our plans, 9/11 happened. Kay was working as the folklorist for the Brooklyn Arts Council and turned all her attention toward documenting and recording people’s personal and aesthetic responses. By the middle of the decade, I was despairing of our chances of ever getting the book going, so I submitted my paper on “Fitcher’s (Queer) Bird” (ATU 311) to <i>Marvels &amp; Tales</i>, and they accepted it (2008).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, Kay and I resolved that we had to complete that transgressing! We proposed <i>Transgressive Tales </i>to Wayne State University Press’s Series in Fairy Tale Studies and they accepted. With a combination of work from seasoned scholars and from students, we looked at some literary rewritings, but also at traditional stories. For my own contribution, I managed to sneak in a Canadian fairy tale&#8211;“Peg Bearskin” in Newfoundland and “La Poiluse” in Francophone northern Ontario&#8211;about a gutsy, masculine-looking and -acting young woman who saves her sisters, seeks adventures and impossible tasks, and eventually marries a prince and magically transforms (herself) into a more feminine presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think reading these archetypal stories through a queer lens is important?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I like to use the insights of film theorist Alexander Doty on “queering” cinema, because they apply to nearly everything else also. The concept of queering too often “implies taking a thing that is straight and doing something to it” (2000, 2). Doty points out that heterosexual readings are conventionally presumed to be intrinsic, where queer and trans readings, then, must necessarily be taking an already-straight text and rendering it queer&#8211;an additive process, a reading-into, a twisting. Doty disagrees with that perspective, and so do I. We presume that texts have no essential sex, gender, or sexuality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certainly a lot of fairy tales look superficially straight (especially as redacted by those who bring their Christian, heteronormative perspectives, like the Brothers Grimm). Many focus on heterosexual marriage&#8211;either as an ending for men or as the beginning of women’s troubles! (discussed by Holbek 1987). However, sometimes one can be absolutely flabbergasted by how close to the surface queerness is; a lot of fairy tales really work well to undermine heteronormative presumptions. To quote Lewis Seifert, one of the first American scholars to start outing fairy tales, in his introduction to the recent special issue of <i>Marvels &amp; Tales</i>, called “Queer(ing) Fairy Tales,” a lot of times we find “erotic innuendo hiding in plain sight” (2015, 17)&#8211;and, I would add, queer and trans content similarly hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How could I NOT have seen the gay/lesbian/trans elements in those cross-dressing ballads? Because everything I’d learned growing up straight, and being intellectually formed in the discipline of folklore in the 1970s and 1980s, taught me to simply gloss over them! How can we NOT see a fairy tale type called “The Shift of Sex” (ATU 514), in which a woman transforms into man, as being about transgender expression (Greenhill and Anderson-Grégoire 2014)? What’s NOT queer about a story about a boy born half human, half hedgehog, who rides off on his shod cock (Greenhill 2014a)? Why should pointing out lesbian elements in a story like Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Snow Queen”&#8211;like Little Robber Girl kissing and sleeping with Gerda, so thoroughly overplayed especially in male directors’ live action films of the tale (Greenhill 2015)&#8211;seem anything other than obvious? In part because we’re taught that fairy tales are for kids, who are of course (wrongly!) presumed to be sexuality-free, its queer/trans content (presumed X-rated) seems invisible/impossible! And because, as Doty pointed out, the presumption that everyone and everything is always heterosexual prevails. But once you start looking&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your favorite fairy tale and why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> I confess to being a bit fickle in my fairy-tale loves. When I was working on “Fitcher’s Bird,” I was smitten. Then “Peg Bearskin/La Poiluse” called me, and “The Shift of Sex,” and “Hans My Hedgehog” (ATU 411). Lately in my fairy-tale film research I’ve branched out to include literary fairy tales, and I was watching and writing about cinema based on Andersen’s “The Snow Queen.” I was fascinated by the differences I saw between male directors’ readings of the story and the sexualities involved, and those of four (feminist) women directors (Greenhill 2016).</p>
<p>But the only fairy tale I actually tell&#8211;teaching is my usual performance&#8211;is a version of “The Robber Bridegroom” (ATU 955). I first heard it told by The Folktellers at the <a href="http://winnipegfolkfestival.ca/folk-fest/">Winnipeg Folk Festival</a>, a long time ago. There’s so much to love in that story. It’s a thriller&#8211;the story-within-a-story that the hero/ine uses to save themself; the triple incremental repetition “Be bold!” “Be bold, be bold!” “Be bold, be bold, but not so bold, lest that your heart’s blood should run cold.” I so appreciate the horror moments in fairy tales&#8211;especially when, as in “Fitcher’s Bird,” “Peg Bearskin,” “The Shift of Sex,” and of course “The Robber Bridegroom,” the sister, usually the younger sister, like me, eventually prevails.</p>
<p><strong>What have you been working on recently?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My colleagues Jill Terry Rudy, Naomi Hamer, Lauren Bosc and I are co-editing the<i> Routledge Companion to Fairy-Tale Cultures and Media</i>. I’ve promised a monograph called <i>Species of Magic and Wonder: Transgender, Transbiology, and Transformation in Fairy-Tale Media </i>to the Wayne State University Press Series in Fairy-Tale Studies. My colleagues Martin Lovelace, Anita Best and I are doing <i>“The Maid in the Thick of the Well”: Gender and the Magic Tales of Alice Lannon and Pius Power Senior</i>, a book on the ten magic tales collected from two Newfoundland source tellers. I’ve applied for a grant to do more on justice issues and fairy-tale media with Canadian and international colleagues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://iftf.uwinnipeg.ca/">The International Fairy-Tale Filmography online</a> needs constant updating. And I want to do more on two films: <i>Celestial Clockwork </i>(directed by Fina Torres, 1995), a lesbian/gay/queer transnational version of “Cinderella” (ATU 510A) about a Venezuelan mezzo-soprano in Paris trying to get the lead role in a film of Rossini’s <i>La Cenerentola</i>; and<i> The Fall</i> (directed by Tarsem Singh, 2006), another story-in-story story which explores storytelling and is visually amazing, having been filmed in more than 20 countries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m hoping to do more participant-observation on film sites with the fabulous women from <a href="http://www.redczarina.com/">Red Czarina</a>. Director Danishka Esterhazy welcomed a student research assistant and me to the set of <a href="http://www.hg-movie.com/"><i>H &amp; G </i></a>, a “Hansel and Gretel” (ATU 327A) film centring on Winnipeg and the surrounding countryside. It was a fantastic experience to see a movie being made. Danishka is in post-production on <i>The Singing Bones</i>, based on Francesca Lia Block’s “Beauty and the Beast” (ATU 425C) short story called “Bones.” Rebecca Gibson will be directing “Jane Garbage,” a modern “Cinderella” story. And check out Danishka’s earlier fairy tale films, <a href="http://www.danishkaesterhazy.com/portfolio/the-snow-queen/"><i>The Snow Queen </i></a>and <a href="http://www.danishkaesterhazy.com/portfolio/the-red-hood/">The Red Hood</a>&#8211;a riff on “Little Red Riding Hood” (ATU 333).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So much has been done on film since Sidney Eve Matrix and I did <i>Fairy Tale Films: Visions of Ambiguity </i>(2010) and Jack Zipes’s <i>The Enchanted Screen: The Unknown History of Fairy Tale Films </i>(2011) came out. (I have to give a shout out to Jack who has been an amazing supporter, mentor, and collaborator.  Thanks, Jack!) And many new fairy-tale films have come out, which I’m dying to share with the wonderful Women’s and Gender Studies students&#8211;and of course all the other students&#8211;at the University of Winnipeg. I’m hoping to teach a fairy-tale film course in Fall 2017 and screen some films I’ve encountered recently as well as some old favourites. My students loved <i>The Wolves of Kromer </i>(directed by Will Gould, 1998), a sweet film using “Little Red Riding Hood” to reflect on homophobia. And of course, all the cool new theory and analysis, including Anne Duggan’s (2013) work on Jacques Demy’s fairy tale films and Cristina Bacchilega’s (2013) de-colonising reflection on the transnational fairy tale web.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>At the edge of the forest, the they-child saw the one-clawed bird, its feathers glinting cerulean in the sun. The bird stopped preening itself and stared; the they-child put their fingers to their neck and slowly shook, until the mask they wore wiggled loose. Off came the long auburn hair, the blue eyes ringed with sleeplessness, the mud-red collar buttoned to the chin. Underneath it the they-child was something else, something more splendid and strange, for the first time. They lifted the girl-mask up as a sort of offering. The bird extended its one giant talon and wrapped it around the part of the mask that had hugged the they-child’s skull. The bird started to fly, slowly at first&#8211;slow enough that the they-child could follow&#8211;and then faster, and the child found themselves lifting off the ground and gliding with new wings above the forest.</em></p>

It’s a very simple tale, with familiar archetypes and motifs: a young person, a bird, the woods, transformation. But it’s a tale that Sotheby’s&#8211;the auction house that owns Toyen’s <em>Message from the Forest</em>, the painting my story is based on&#8211;tells differently. In their version, there is no mask, no avian helper. “An owl-like spectre bearing in its one remaining claw the severed head of a girl,” <a href="http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/european-discoveries/2014/10/message-from-the-forest-toyen.html">says Sotheby’s of the painting</a>; they also refer to Toyen as “she.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> The transmasculine Surrealist has been rendered into a woman; the painting, too, has been broken into its most obvious component parts: “owl-like spectre,” “one remaining claw,” “severed head of a girl.” I want more from it, I see more in it. So I read the painting queerly&#8211;through my own experiences as a non-binary genderqueer person, through what I know about Toyen&#8211;and try to riddle out a message from the forest that makes sense to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the story I choose to write: the girl-face as mask, the one-taloned bird as helper, the they-child running freely, as themselves, into the woods at last. I think of the obvious parallels between my life and the story: my tomboyish adulation of the woods as a child, and the avian name I chose at twenty in an attempt to be proud of my small stature and jumpy mannerisms, to give myself a non-binary name that fit my non-binary gender. I think, too, about which story Toyen would have preferred&#8211;mine or Sotheby’s, or neither. I struggle to imagine Toyen&#8211;an avowed anarchist, who hid his artistic partner, the poet Jindřich Heisler, of Jewish descent, from the Nazis&#8211;seeing nature, rather than humanity, as evil. Though perhaps he used the brightly colored bird as a stand-in for sinister human acts: Sotheby’s does say, “An image of anxiety and helplessness, it gave rise to the series of twelve drawings that []he embarked on over the next two years, influenced by the Nazis occupation of Prague, entitled <em>Spectres of the Desert</em>.” Sotheby’s has, I’m sure, proper art historians writing their descriptions, with proper training in historical context and technique&#8211;although I wonder what their biases make them overlook, or what they choose to ignore.</p>
<p>When I try to find something transgressive behind <em>Message from the Forest</em>&#8211;a bit of overlooked history, or a queer reading of the painting&#8211;perhaps I&#8217;ll only find my own reflection: the face of a strange and overgrown they-child standing, at the edge of the woods, girl-mask outstretched, hands trembling, wings pushing out through my shoulder blades. I&#8217;ll offer up the-gender-which-is-not-me-but-has-been-ascribed-to-me to my avian friend, who takes it and leads me deep into the woods, over rock and vine and river, to a place where all the birds are singing.
