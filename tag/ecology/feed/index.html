<p style="text-align: justify;">I picture my mother at the helm of a boat somewhere in the thick of ocean. Floating behind the boat is a glacier, a compression of quiet grace. My mother has tied a thousand ancient ropes to the glacier and is pulling it through the water with the same conviction that I imagine Moses had when he parted the sea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-534" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-1024x681.jpg" alt="16286584359_778ff002ed_k" width="660" height="439" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-300x199.jpg 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-768x510.jpg 768w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For years, she has whispered her plan to us. Before they all melt, my mother wants to transport a glacier from Alaska to wherever my sister and I are living, so that we will have a secure source of water. To keep it from melting, she will coat the glacier in sawdust, as if sprinkling confectioner&#8217;s sugar on a slice of bundt cake. Then, she will chain it to a tugboat and tow it across the ocean, where it will finally be left in a dry pond or a desert&#8217;s scorched riverbed so that my sister and I will not die of thirst. We have always rolled our eyes to this idea. <em>Impossible,</em> we&#8217;ve said. But, recently, I&#8217;ve wondered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the night of her seventieth birthday, my mother told my sister and I that some scientists believe the moon was once part of the earth. This theory surmises that when the moon separated from the earth, the Pacific Ocean was formed in its void. We were eating pineapple-upside-down cake in the flicker of candlelight, she was wearing a white kimono and a halo made from fourteen carmine flowers, and my sister and I balked at the idea. But my mother insisted until my sister googled it. <em>It&#8217;s called the fission hypothesis,</em> my sister says. <em>I guess I have to get a PhD,</em> my mother responded with a tilt of her halo,<em> for people to listen to me.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over a decade ago, my mother had a theory that the energy from the moving bodies at gyms or playgrounds could be used for electricity. When she and I walked past fitness centers with treadmills in the windows, she pointed to the sweating bodies and said,<em> Imagine how many light bulbs they could be powering?</em> My eyes went from the runners&#8217; wet, mangled hair to the ceiling, where fluorescent lights hummed incessantly above their heads, but I wasn&#8217;t convinced. Years later, my sister saw an advertisement: a company was utilizing the velocity of playing children to power electrical outlets in a playground.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maybe I’m wrong to not believe that you can part the sea, that a body can run enough to flash on a light bulb, that the moon can slice itself from the earth and spiral out into the knitted black of the sky. Maybe I am wrong to not picture the glacier, hulking and glossy, rising over the sea like a skyscraper; to not look closely at this image until I can see my mother&#8217;s reflection in the ice, waving at the distant sight of land, her salty seaweed hair swept into the sea-wind, rough waves smacking against the sides of the boat. If I look even closer, I will discern on my mother&#8217;s face not only the knowledge that her family&#8217;s thirst will forever be quenched, but also that now, after all these years, they will maybe, finally, believe her.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Dodge Ram scrambles over rocks and rain-hewn ditches; water gallons and bean cans jostle  in the truck bed. I gaze out the window, stretch my pointer fingers and thumbs then hold my hands catty-corner to pretend I’m making postcards. <em>Snap!</em>—everything gold, gilded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sinking-sun landscape looks like one of those photo essays from <em>Arizona Highways</em> I leaf through in the library. The Altar Valley is amber with cholla and prickly pear, acacia and mesquite trees. The dusk casts miniature, scattered mountain ranges in vermilions and mauves. Baboquivari’s cuspate peak stands sentinel above it all, so backlit that it looks like its cut out of black construction paper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Golden hour is seductive enough to lure me towards forgetting. I pull myself back, remind myself that the recent history of this desert is a catalogue of predacious desire for <em>aurum</em>, Au, the metal that shines like the sun:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;">1540: Coronado (arrogant, silver-plated) searches the Southwest for Cíbola, the legendary city of gold. He finds no such city but still plunders towns and villages, leaving death and destruction in his Spanish wake.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;">Pima County, 1774: Manuel Lopez, a Spanish holy man, forces a group of Tohono O’odham to extract gold from the Quijotoa Mountains. Thus begins gold mining in Arizona.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;">1877: White settlers open the Montana Mine in Ruby, Arizona. Until 1940, when it’s abandoned, residents extract gold, silver, lead, zinc, and copper from the mine.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: justify;">(Ruby is now <em>one of the two best-preserved mining ghost towns in Arizona</em> according to Wikipedia, twenty-five-odd buildings scattered on a hillside below the gaping mine mouth. The mine is home to thousands of Mexican free-tailed bats that swirl into the darkening summer sky, going north-south-east-west in search of bugs, disregarding the nearby cattle fence that splits two countries like a wound.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then there’s my own white, middle-class childhood. 1994: I’m five, in a pink-painted bedroom just north of New York City, thousands of miles from this dusty border. My father reads to me from <em>My First Book of Fairy Tales</em>. The illustrations are full of golden objects&#8211;the giant’s eggs in “Jack and the Beanstalk,” Cinderella’s pumpkin coach. After he finishes a story, my father asks, “What’s the golden rule?” and I respond, well taught, “He who has the gold makes the rules.” It’s his favorite punchline. We laugh, oblivious to how it implicates us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The princesses in the volume have locks so burnished they seem incendiary&#8211;like they might, at any moment, burst into flame.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">I’ve found myself fascinated, lately and distantly, by the accumulation of human action. I like to believe that as our universe expands it makes more space for beauty or good, which has dimensions and mass and density. We see a poet who puts affecting work into the world and we see small bits of beauty settle into once-empty spaces of her readers. It is matter; it matters. It takes up space, but unlike other matter, it can’t be destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One story<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> of the beaver posits a different perspective on the universe:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-19-at-9.44.47-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-447 aligncenter" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-19-at-9.44.47-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-19 at 9.44.47 PM" width="491" height="447" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-19-at-9.44.47-PM.png 491w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-19-at-9.44.47-PM-300x273.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I find myself fascinated with this story, not because of its brevity, and not just because of its apocalyptic vision—what strikes me is a universe built around anger as the constant, and not beauty, or not good, or not anything else that might not be contained by mathematics. I think about us all toppling. I think about the end of ends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But this is just one story humans have told about beavers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another story about beavers is that they hate the sound of running water, hence their famous drive to build dams and lodges—in truth, a trickle triggers an instinctual response, to package a leak in the dam with young willow or the branches of birch. It’s both more simple and more complex than we give them credit for. Hate, it seems, is a human specialty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another story about beavers is recorded early by Aesop, famous for his fables: “When pursued, the beaver runs for some distance, but when he sees he cannot escape, he will bite off his own testicles and throw them to the hunter, and thus escape death.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[2]</a> This belief percolates for roughly two millennia, until the 17th Century, when Sir Thomas Browne points out that a beaver’s testicles do not pendulate outside the body, making self-castration difficult.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In the seventeenth century, his Holiness the Pope adjudged beavers to be fish. In retrospect, that was a zoologically illogical decision; but beavers were not miffed at being changed into fish,” writes essayist Amy Leach.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[3]</a> Surely anyone who had touched or skinned a beaver must have known the truth, but correcting the papacy  hasn’t always been easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We can see here the spectrum of stories about one thing, but also many: some are simply incorrect, some are mischaracterizations, some can be outwitted by science or simple observation, some exist beyond us, some we’ll never be sure of. But my fascination with all of these stories is that each of us readers have space to make our own meaning of them. We get to decide correctness or incorrectness, and someone else can do the opposite. We can react, retell, recast. We can always make beautiful, if that is what we choose to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is much in the world that I believe would make the Great White Grandfather Beaver angry. Lately, this feels hauntingly present, and it all, too, accumulates, in the shape of the thinning pole that keeps up our world. But I also like to believe in an addendum, in a story beyond the story of the “The Gnawing”: It is known that if one goes alone or in a group, in the evening, to tear down the local beaver dam twig by twig, send them all down the newly-made stream, the beavers will stay up through the night to make the necessary repairs. And maybe the Great White Grandfather Beaver might spend a night gnawing through the anger to find a broken pole and a broken world that leaks water or something worse, and that he, like all good beavers, might decide instead to fashion a dam to hold up the world and make it quiet again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That is a story I can believe. A little more time to tell old stories, and make new ones from the old, and to find ways to convince the Great White Grandfather Beaver that we are worth the work, even if we are terrible, and even if our beautiful isn’t enough.</p>

<p><em>I lived in Appalachia for four years, and it&#8217;s there that I encountered&#8211;and fell in love with&#8211;Appalachian ballad singing. Sparse and haunting, ballads are usually sung without instrumentation and tell melancholy tales of betrayal and lost love. Many draw on traditional literature&#8211;like folklore and fairy tales&#8211;and the medieval romance tradition. I wanted to know more, so I asked my friend <a href="http://www.sarosings.com/">Saro Lynch-Thomason</a>, a folklorist and ballad singer, a few questions.</em></p>
<p><em>Lynch-Thomason&#8211;who is based in Asheville, North Carolina&#8211;is also an illustrator, author, and social activist. In 2012 she completed </em><a href="http://www.blairpathways.com/">Blair Pathways: A Musical Exploration of America’s Largest Labor Uprising</a><em>&#8211;a researched compilation of over 20 historic songs from West Virginia’s labor wars. Saro has led the Asheville Community Sing since 2010 and regularly teaches regional ballad workshops, Wassailing choruses, and May Day choruses on social justice themes. In 2013, Saro completed her solo CD </em><a href="https://sarolyncht.bandcamp.com/album/vessel">Vessel</a><em>&#8211;an acappella compilation of ballads and songs from Appalachia and the British Isles. Her distinct, powerful singing style transports audiences to Appalachian mountain hollers, 19th-century coal camps and old meeting houses.</em></p>
<p>(As a heads up, this interview mentions sexual assault.)</p>
<p><strong>Ballad singing traveled from the British Isles to Appalachia, where you live. Can you tell me a little bit about ballad singing, how it originated and how it ended up in the U.S. Mountain South?</strong></p>
<p>Ballads as they are often referred to today reference a particular story-song form that has been in Europe for nearly 1,000 years. Often a ballad involves first or third person narration, a simple rhyme scheme and a repeated melody. In the 1100s and 1200s, this form of storytelling was popular across what is modern-day France and Spain. A class of minstrels, supported by nobility, traveled and composed poetry and songs in this format. Over 2,000 poems have survived from this period, along with hundreds of melodies.</p>
<p>Since then there have been several periods of songwriting popularity, during which everyone from nobles to peasants took an interest in creating and singing their own ballads. Many ballads were written in the Middle Ages, about 300 of which survive today. But many ballads come from a revival period that began in the 1600s and had its heyday with the creation of the letterpress. People wrote and dispersed songs across Europe and America, drawing on old melodies and themes but with updated characters and political messaging.</p>
<p>During this period many ballads came to America, brought by immigrants from England, Ireland, and Scotland who arrived throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Immigrants families carried and adapted these songs for generations as they worked and settled across the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, the Piedmont in North Carolina, and the Appalachian Mountains. These song styles became dispersed into Afro-Appalachian communities as well, where people continued to change them.</p>
<p><span id="more-355"></span></p>
<p><strong>How did you become interested in ballads? What has your journey studying, singing and teaching ballads been like?</strong></p>
<p>Growing up in Nashville, TN, my parents played music from the British folk revival of the 60s and 70s alongside contemporary composers who drew from traditional sources&#8211;singers like Sinead O’Connor and Loreena McKennitt. I latched on to the ballads I heard and spent time by myself memorizing them. In addition, my aunts had learned many ballads in the folk revival era, and taught me songs from their repertoire.</p>
<p>When I attended college in the Northeast I met other people my age who studied and sang ballads. Having peers who were just as interested in these songs as I was encouraged me to learn more. After school I moved to Western North Carolina to connect with the many traditional singing communities there, and I’ve been studying ballads ever since.</p>
<p>The process of hearing a ballad, learning it, and teaching it has always felt very emotional and spiritual to me. Knowing that a song has been carried from body to body for generations is a powerful thing. A song has to really resonate with many people in order for it to be passed and remembered and cherished for long periods of time. When I sing a ballad, I feel like I’m not only inheriting the song but the community of people who have sung it. I have an invisible circle of folks who affirm my feelings and connection to the song’s content. Getting to teach these songs to others, and learning what the stories mean to them, is a rewarding and revelatory experience.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of stories do ballads tell? How do ballads relate to traditional forms of literature, like folk and fairy tales?</strong></p>
<p>Ballads can tell just about every kind of story. They’ve been used to spread news, to teach moral lessons, as political propaganda, as escapist fantasies, and as fatalistic laments. Since these story songs have been around since at least the 1100s, it’s impossible to generalize what they tell about. Different eras do seem to have had favored themes, though. In America, for example, popular ballad themes have included murders (often based on real events), cowboy tales, betrayed love, and train wrecks. In the 1600s and 1700s in England many ballads detailed the dramas of the nobility (sort of like modern-day tabloids), lamented sailors’ deaths at sea, and celebrated famous battles.</p>
<p>For as long as these songs have been around they’ve enjoyed a close relationship with literature. Starting in the same period that medieval minstrelsy was popular across Europe&#8211;the 1100s&#8211; there was a literary form popular among nobility called romance writing. Nobles and aristocracy would write stories inspired by legends and older histories, using prose and verse forms. Over time people truncated these stories, added a tune, and started singing them. In turn, these ballads could eventually inspire new poetry or novels.</p>
<p>A great example of the interweaving of literary and musical storytelling can be seen in the Thomas of Erceldoune legend. Thomas of Erceldoune was a Scottish lord in the 1200s. According to legend, he was a seer and prophet, and is also credited with writing the English version of the romance “Tristram and Isolde”- a precursor to the Lancelot and Guinevere legend. Erceldoune passed away in the late 1200s, and about one hundred years later someone decided to write a romance praising his abilities. The narrative is written from Thomas’ perspective, and explains that he received his gifts of prophecy from a fairy queen. By the 1700s, this romance had become a ballad. The first verse of many versions says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">True Thomas lay on Huntlie bank,<br />
A ferlie he spied wi’ his ee,<br />
And there he saw a lady bright,<br />
Come riding down by the Eildon Tree.</p>
<p>Thomas spies a “ferlie” with his “ee,” or “eye. In the Scots language a “ferlie” is a “wonder,” in this case the wondrous site of the fairy queen approaching Thomas to take him to her realm.</p>
<p>During the same period this song was popular, a literary ballad revival was taking place in Europe. Aristocratic scholars and writers began to collect and study ballads, using them as inspiration for poetry. One of these artists, Sir Walter Scott, collected the Thomas ballad and wrote his own third part to the narrative, extending the story and reviving interest in the singing of the ballad.</p>
<p>The song seems to have made its way to America, and was written down in the mid-1900s from a version sung by a woman named Becky Gordon in Western North Carolina. Her first verse reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">True Thomas lay on yonder hill<br />
And saw a lady gay<br />
A lady that was bright and fair<br />
Come riding down the way</p>
<p>I found this ballad in a collection of North Carolina folklore and added my own tune since it had none. I’ve been singing it for a few years now. To me, it’s a “ferlie” that a story like True Thomas has been around for so long, and I think its survival and popularity is due to the fact that it has taken literary forms many times.</p>
<p>Some people argue that if a ballad is written down, it begins to die&#8211;that putting the narrative to paper means people will stop knowing it and holding it in their minds and memory. I think the history of Thomas of Erceldoune demonstrates that the relationship between written stories and sung stories is natural and mutually beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>You’re interested in the sociopolitical dimensions of ballad singing. How does your work with ballads – as well as the ballads themselves&#8211; relate to issues like feminism, economic justice, and environmental destruction in Appalachia?</strong></p>
<p>Ballads have a powerful political dimension to them&#8211;they can be used to push against cultural expectations or to affirm them. Which meaning a ballad has is often up to the interpretation of the singers and listeners.</p>
<p>I’ve been teaching workshops for a while that focus on women’s experiences in ballads. Some of the stories in ballads are about the hardest experiences women go through&#8211;like economic disenfranchisement, abortion and sexual assault. In some ballads women face these challenges and find creative solutions to overcome them, and in others they simply have to bear the weight of these traumas. In my workshops, I’ve been exploring how these kinds of stories can be viewed as empowering in the right context. For example, a song that I’ve enjoyed singing to myself for years is called simply “Queen Jane.” The ballad is about a rape, and I’ve sung it to myself, alone, countless times as a way to emotionally process my experiences of sexual assault. It’s such an intense song that I would have trouble hearing or sharing it in a public space, but the solitary practice of singing it has been a great comfort to me. Whoever originally wrote “Queen Jane” may not have had that use in mind for the song, but that’s how ballads work&#8211;the songs survive because they take on personal meanings to people. This use of ballads as processing tools for traumatic experiences is profound and moving to me as a feminist and activist.</p>
<p>As an organizer in Appalachia, I’ve enjoyed using ballads as overtly political statements. A lot of European songs from hundreds of years ago speak to the same issues Appalachians are facing today, including <a href="http://content.sierraclub.org/coal/mining-destroying-mountains">environmental destruction </a>and lack of access to land. English ballads about the enclosure of the commons could easily describe <a href="http://auroralights.org/map_project/theme.php?theme=coal_river_101&amp;article=14">the modern state of private land ownership</a> in Appalachia. Some of these older songs also tell about rebellions and land reclamation movements, suggesting strategies that could be used today.</p>
<p>One of my favorite political ballads is an adaptation of an English song called &#8220;The Cutty Wren.” The song is thought to have originally been a coded rebel song about killing the king and dispersing his riches. One of the characters in the song declares, “We’ll shoot the cutty wren!” &#8212; the wren being a longtime symbol of kings and rulers. In the new version, adapted by ballad singer and Appalachian activist Michael Kline, the song details the plans of a group of people to blow up a bulldozer on a strip site. The same character declares, “We’ll blow the big dozer!”</p>
<p>Appalachians have taken older songs like this and countless times adapted them to their own struggles. Like all ballad singing, whether the song ends sadly or hopefully it serves the purpose of connecting many generations and helping the singer move through their own struggles. It’s an empowering and affirming tool that I hope continues for at least another thousand years.</p>

<p>I should note that there were no moose in my fairy tales. Mice would weave dresses and songbirds wing in to harmonize, rats prey on babies, wolves leer at unaccompanied minors, and snakes give terrible advice, but for all her bedtime vespers Grandmother never had a word to offer on the moose. Moreover, I lacked an authoritative source to aid in personification of muskrats, ground squirrels, and particularly heather voles. The cats (duplicitous, self-serving) enjoyed sucking members of our abundant backyard vole community down to dollhouse rugs, and I struggled to decide what to make of it. Of course, a mouse in the house was inclined to die in the walls as opposed to sew me a back-to-school sweater, and the only rat I knew was Evans, who ate a lot of yogurt chips and liked to sleep in my sleeves.</p>
<p>Of the moose I had absolutely no guidance. <em>Rocky and Bullwinkle</em> couldn’t be taken as communion; it lacked the mystic energy of tale layered over tale, the spiritual ambiguity of a frog emerging from the well with a golden ball or an ugly little man spinning straw by starlight.</p>
<p>Now that the moose are dying I wonder what it means for the stories, and I figure not much. There are ghost moose, which surely should mean something (hypothetical: the Little Match Girl is rescued from mortal hallucinations on the back of patchy, white-skinned moose), but moose as a fairy-species were passed over when they could have been messengers of kind fatality or knobby-kneed saviors, always owl-like with wisdom. Instead the ticks got them, a thousand sucking parasites to fell a thousand pounds of animal. Carbon dioxide got them, far from the realm of wicked witches or sadistic stepparents.</p>
<p>When I tired of the princesses, Grandma ought to have subbed in a moose for Little Red. I like to believe a moose would know a wolf in sheep’s clothing. She would never be selfish or preening. She would know to fear the foe and not the forest, though I admit I’m spouting pure conjecture. I do know that a moose forswears a moral. She promises uncertainty and wildness. Moose are all the allegory I need for a good story, antlers added. They fade into Faerie meek as ghosts, and the birds build nests from their fur.</p>

<p>At home, by the river, dishes pile up in the sink and the front steps are cracked and littered with Pall Mall cigarettes. It is chaos there: filthy with too many people living in too small of a space. Here, in the woods, it’s calm. At least it is in this stretch of twenty feet, with nettles and rhododendrons and tulip poplar leaves crunching underfoot. I chew on spicy sassafras, let it fill my mouth with the taste of this place: earth and green, unbearable green. <em>Almost heaven. </em></p>
<p>Almost. Large portions of the mountain underfoot are hollow. Throughout the twentieth-century, it was mined out bit by bit, its coal shipped to cities like Pittsburgh and Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Ali Baba&#8217;s mountain held forty thieves; in the Grimm Brothers version, a girl attends an elven baptism in a mountain and learns that her three-day stay was actually seven years. Appalachian trickster Jack slips through a hole on a mountain slope. He finds a mirror world down there, with a house and a barn and a woman to wed.</p>
<p>This is not that kind of mountain. A few ridges over, billions of gallons of toxic coal sludge are stored in a slurry pond on the mountaintop. The pond is built over a network of abandoned underground mines. Massey Coal is blasting rock just two hundred feet away, further destabilizing geology. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> For those who live downstream, the slurry pond is an ever-present threat: a dam break could send forty feet of water through the narrow Coal River Valley. <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>(I do not live downstream, not really. I am a stranger here: an idealistic twenty-year-old trying to “save the mountains.” I will move back to New York as soon as it becomes untenable. I will take my memories with me, turn them in to metaphors.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an old mine entrance on the trail, a stone archway half-hidden by twisting rhododendron limbs. If Jack came along, I wonder if he&#8217;d skip right in, try his hand at tricking a giant and eating off of his subterranean table. Times have changed, Jack. You will only find darkness, bitumen, rusting tools, the occasional <em>drip, drip, drip</em>.</p>
