								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The notebook arrived a few months ago in a box of old things my mom sent from the house I grew up in. It was originally a gift from a high school sweetheart, filled with notes from friends about my talents and how much they appreciated me. It sounds, at first description, like the kind of thing that would fill me with nostalgia for my punkish teen years. But opening the notebook was excruciatingly awkward. The gift had been prompted by my low self-confidence and anxiety, which left me feeling like friends secretly despised me and regularly led them to actually despise me, after I confronted them for imagined transgressions. I didn&#8217;t even read the notes&#8211;I didn&#8217;t need to, I knew they were full of the same kind comments that had been used reassure me throughout my life (comments that I would not&#8211;or could not&#8211;believe). Instead, I tore those pages out and threw them away. The only thing that remains from the original gift is a Tolkien quote penned on the notebook&#8217;s inside cover:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Still round the corner there may wait</em><br />
<em> A new road or a secret gate</em><br />
<em> And though I oft have passed them by</em><br />
<em> A day will come at last when I</em><br />
<em> Shall take the hidden paths that run</em><br />
<em> West of the Moon, East of the Sun.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tumblr_nmuvzrd51g1rne95fo6_500.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-283"><img class="wp-image-283 alignright" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tumblr_nmuvzrd51g1rne95fo6_500.jpg" alt="tumblr_nmuvzrd51g1rne95fo6_500" width="372" height="200" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tumblr_nmuvzrd51g1rne95fo6_500.jpg 500w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tumblr_nmuvzrd51g1rne95fo6_500-300x161.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px" /></a>I recently watched <em>Song of the Sea</em>, an animated film by Ireland&#8217;s Cartoon Saloon. The film&#8217;s villain is the owl-witch Macha, who turns mythical creatures&#8211;like faeries and giants&#8211;into stone to &#8220;save&#8221; them from negative emotions. She stores her own difficult emotions and memories in bottles and jars. Of course (spoiler alert!), <em>Song of the Sea</em> is about a brother and sister&#8217;s successful attempt to turn Macha back into the good witch she once was and release the enchanted creatures from their stone holds. They&#8217;re able to do so when a magical song&#8211;sung by the sister who is, it turns out, a selkie&#8211; causes Macha&#8217;s bottles and jars to break. Macha&#8217;s forced to swallow up the despair she&#8217;s been hiding from, and this swallowing allows the desired transformation to take place.</p>
<p>My notebook feels a little like one of Macha&#8217;s shattered jars&#8211;a ghost of the emotions it once contained. The Tolkien quote on the inside cover doesn&#8217;t let me forget what this notebook was originally for; neither does my anxiety, which I&#8217;m learning to manage but continue to live with. Yet, I am able to re-inscribe it, re-purpose it, fill it up with something new. I&#8217;ve been using it as my <em>Tiny Donkey</em> notebook&#8211;where I jot down to-do lists or take notes during our editorial meetings. It&#8217;s a fitting use for it, I think. Reading, studying and writing about fairy tales has become, for me, a wondrous obsession, the kind of thing that serves as a temporary respite from a self-doubting and anxious brain.</p>
