								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a statue near the border of Nogales, Arizona of a small boy. Every time my mother, brother, and I would walk by she’d turn to us and say that if we misbehaved or did not follow her instructions we would become a statue just like that small boy. My mother was always aided by folk tales or myths to scare us into thinking that if we deliberately disobeyed her, consequences would arise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mother is from Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. Molded by a culture full of folk tales and old proverbs, she passed on generations of stories to my siblings and I.  My mother shared the legends of El Cucuy, the Mexican boogeymann and El Chupacabra, a goat-like creature the size of a small bear&#8211;its spines reaching from its neck to the base of its tail&#8211;that haunts the desert. She also told me about La Llorona.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">La Llorona</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is told as a cautionary tale to children to make them behave properly. Different versions of the story are told depending on the region. Some say the story focuses on Maria, a woman so beautiful that all the men in her town attempted to woo her each time she walked by. Maria, with a sense of self absorption, believed she deserved the attention. She would flirt with the men but vowed only to marry the most handsome and wealthiest man she could find. The only problem interfering with her lifestyle? Her two sons. So she decided to drown them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other versions of the tale say Maria married a wealthy man and they were happy. She bore him two sons. After a time, the man would go away for long periods of time and when he returned, only focused on his sons. One day, he returned with another woman at his side and left again. Enraged, Maria drowned her two children in the river. Maria became deeply remorseful and wandered along the banks hoping her sons would return. It is said that when she finally died, her weeping spirit wandered the land, crying, “¡Ay, mis hijos!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-822 size-full" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault.jpg 480w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day when I was five, my three siblings and I were playing a game of freeze tag on my grandma’s patio. Our dogs chased and barked at us. The daylight was quickly vanishing and the street lamps were turning on. As the sun set, my mother called out to us and yelled it was time to return inside. We didn’t listen. She yelled out, “¡Si no regresan ya, los va a agarrar La Llorona!” which roughly translates to, “If you don’t return now, La Llorona will come get you.” My brothers stopped playing and ran inside. I didn’t understand who my mom was speaking of because I was the youngest and had not heard the tale. I stayed outside for another five minutes and when I decided to go back, I found the door was locked. My mom on the other side said it was too late and La Llorona coming. Panicking, I begged to go inside. She hesitated. I said I was sorry for not coming back when she asked. The door unlocked and I ran inside. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat on a rusty old stool as I listened to my mother explain the importance of La Llorona. A weeping women all dressed in a white dress and her face covered by a white veil. She wouldn’t rest until she found her kids. That’s when my mom uttered the word: “Unless&#8230;” I stared at her, tightening my eyebrows. “Unless she finds other children, children who misbehave, and takes them instead.” I felt my skin lose its smoothness and small bumps started forming from my forearm to my shoulder. “La Llorona will come as soon as the lights on the street start turning on. Make sure you’re inside when the street lamps glow.</span></p>

<p><em>Aaron Mahnke is the writer, host, and producer of <a href="http://www.lorepodcast.com/">Lore</a>, a podcast about true life scary stories. When he&#8217;s not working on Lore, Mahnke writes <a href="http://aaronmahnke.com/novels/">supernatural thrillers</a>. He lives with his family in the historic Boston area, in the very heart of Lovecraft Country and the epicenter of the Salem witch trials. You can follow him <a href="http://www.twitter.com/amahnke" target="_blank">here</a> on Twitter, and learn more about him on his <a href="http://www.aaronmahnke.com" target="_blank">website</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>I chatted with Mahnke about the similarities between fairy tales and horror, and the relationship between folklore and history.</em></p>
<p><strong>Can you start by talking a bit about LORE? Why did you decide to make the podcast? What got you interested in the history behind folklore, horror and ghost stories?</strong></p>
<p>Lore is a podcast that digs into the darker side of history, uncovering the roots of common folklore and superstition, and exposing some of the more unbelievable motivations and actions of people throughout history. It’s a storytelling podcast, sort of like a fire-side chat, where I tell stories about what happened, and then try to ponder why.</p>
<p>Lore began as a happy accident. In an effort to grow my book sales into something that could justify the time I spent actually writing them, I tried writing a series of non-fiction essays on my five favorite New England folktales and legends. My goal was to give that away as an incentive to people willing to sign up on my fiction email list. But the project got a bit too long, and so I decided to try converting it to audio.</p>
</div>
<p><span id="more-388"></span></p>
<p>After a friend heard the first essay, he convinced me to skip the mailing list plan and publish it as a public podcast. The rest is history, I suppose!</p>
<p>My interests are in history, the unexplainable, and cultural anthropology. I love digging into the reasons behind things we believe or do, and have found that the true historical events behind a lot of our common superstitions and folklore have just as much entertainment value (or more) than the fiction we create. The truth can be frightening.</p>
<div>
<p><b>Horror and fairy tales have a lot in common&#8211;like horror, traditional fairy tales tend to be gruesome and violent. Motifs from fairy tales (like enchanted woods and werewolves) sometimes show up on episodes of the podcast. Do fairy tale inspire your work on LORE?</b></p>
<p>Fairy tales are super violent. The stories we grew up on, for the most part, are white-washed, purified versions of the originals. Red-Riding Hood gets eaten by the big bad wolf in the original — after being fed her grandmother’s blood and flesh, mind you — and the woodsman literally has to cut open the wolf to pull her out. It’s a modern horror film to the core.</p>
<p>I’m not sure that fairy tales inspire Lore, but they certainly become the topic for episodes from time to time. Some fairy tales are vessels that hold true events (like the Pied Piper), while others are old tales used to teach a moral or truth. Lore isn’t 100% built on fairy tales, but they are a big part of it.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>I loved the episode where you recounted the history behind the Pied Piper folk tale (<a href="http://www.lorepodcast.com/episodes/24">Episode 24, &#8220;A Stranger Among Us&#8221;</a>). I&#8217;ve wondered about the roots of the Pied Piper legend, and was fascinated by what the episode turned up. How did you come across this history?</strong></p>
<p>How I stumble on to these things is sort of a mixture of accident and stubbornness. I usually read something interesting in one article and then chase it down in other sources to see what might be known. For the Pied Piper history, the wiki page was a great jumping point because it mentions many theories and a common consensus among historians. From there, it’s easy to dig deeper.</p>
<p><strong>In that episode, you talk about how the legend of the Pied Piper was created to explain away a dark historical event: the selling of Hamlin&#8217;s children to locators of the Holy Roman Empire by the townspeople. These locators were looking for people to settle newly conquered land in present-day Poland and, instead of agreeing to go themselves, many towns and villages relinquished their children, instead. Have you come across other examples of folk and fairy tales masking unsavory history?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe not so blatantly, but there are many examples of “edited history”, where the story we read is just part of a larger story. Yes, the <a href="http://www.lorepodcast.com/episodes/episode-3-the-beast-within">werewolf of Bedburg</a> ravaged the village and surrounding area, but in the end, the villagers ravaged him. The victor writes the history, you know?</p>

<p><em><a href="http://carmenmariamachado.com/">Carmen Maria Machado</a> writes rich, fabulist fiction that draws on fairy tales and folklore. She has some exciting publications forthcoming&#8211;including a debut short story collection, </em>Her Body &amp; Other Parties<em> (Graywolf Press), and a story in The Ochre Issue of </em><a href="http://fairytalereview.com/">Fairy Tale Review</a><em>. For this interview, however, I decided to ask Machado about an older story&#8211; <a href="http://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/">&#8220;The Husband Stitch,&#8221;</a> published by </em>Granta<em> in October 2014, and inspired by a frightening children&#8217;s tale, urban legends, and the experience of being an awkward kid at Girl Scout Camp.</em></p>
<p><b>&#8220;The Husband Stitch,&#8221; is a variation on &#8220;The Green Ribbon,&#8221; a popular scary story (I remember it well from childhood!). How did you first encounter &#8220;The Green Ribbon&#8221;? Why did you decide to write your own version of it? </b></p>
<p>I first read “The Green Ribbon” in Alvin Schwartz’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Dark,_Dark_Room_and_Other_Scary_Stories"><i>In a Dark, Dark Room and Other Scary Stories</i></a>, a children’s book in the vein of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scary_Stories_to_Tell_in_the_Dark"><i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i></a> series. (Though with significantly less terrifying illustrations.) Anyway, <i>In a Dark, Dark Room</i> had a story called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3PIkV2anqk">The Green Ribbon</a>,” by which I was simultaneously repulsed and entranced. Of all the urban legend and folktale retellings in Schwartz’s oeuvre, that’s the one that stuck with me the most.</p>
<p>Later, when I was in graduate school, I was hanging out with friends when <i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i> came up in conversation. That series pretty much scared everyone in my generation, and each person in my group had a different story from it that’d scared the bejeesus out of them as kids.</p>
<p>My brain kept returning to “The Green Ribbon,” and it occurred to me that there are all kinds of interesting currents about gender running beneath that story’s deceptively simple ice. That summer, I sat down and wrote the first draft of “<a href="http://granta.com/The-Husband-Stitch/">The Husband Stitch</a>.” At the time, it was just a straight re-telling of the protagonist’s story from meeting her future husband to her head falling off; the metafictional elements and retellings of other urban legends came later in the editing process.</p>
<p><span id="more-305"></span></p>
<p><b>Themes of transgressive female desire and secret female knowledge are central to &#8220;The Husband Stitch.&#8221; The story is based on a scary folk tale, and weaves in references to other frightening stories and fairy tales. What do you think it is about fairy tales, folk tales and scary stories that make them such great devices for exploring these themes? </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kate Bernheimer has a wonderful essay, “<a href="http://www.katebernheimer.com/images/Fairy%20Tale%20is%20Form.pdf">Fairy Tale is Form, Form is Fairy Tale</a>,” in which she praises the “artistic dexterity” of the fairy tale and discusses a critical part of the form: flatness. She writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 90px;">This absence of depth, this flatness, violates a technical rule writers are often taught in beginning writing classes: that a character’s psychological depth is crucial to a story. In a fairy tale, however, this flatness functions beautifully; it allows depth of response in the reader.</p>
<p>This syncs up very closely with my own experience: that an ostensibly flat fairy tale with minimalist, abstract prose permits a range of deep emotions in a capable reader. Plus, a writer adapting a fairy tale has infinite tools at her disposal; she can tweak some or all of the form’s elements, and perform any other number of techniques (modernization, reversal of point-of-view, blending with another story, etc.) into near-infinite variations. The fairy tale is simply an excellent foundation for its own interrogation.</p>
<p>But in addition to the flexibility of the flatness—and perhaps more importantly—there’s also the “fairy tale as mirror” factor. No one will deny that many fairy tales have their own demented, regressive logic and morality, particularly when it comes to issues of gender. Giambattista Basile&#8217;s “The Old Woman Who Was Skinned,” for example—the origin of my <i>Fairy Tale Review</i> story “<a href="http://fairytalereview.com/the-ochre-issue/">The Old Women Who Were Skinned</a>”—is about an old woman permitting herself to be literally skinned so that she might be beautiful as her fairy-transformed sister, with a “lesson” at the end about vanity. “<a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/frog.html#grimm1">The Frog King</a>” is deeply and uncritically rape-y. The Charles Perrault version of “<a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0312.html#perrault">Bluebeard</a>,” a story about abuse and femicide, has <i>two</i> terrible “morals”—</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><b>Moral:</b> Curiosity, in spite of its appeal, often leads to deep regret. To the displeasure of many a maiden, its enjoyment is short lived. Once satisfied, it ceases to exist, and always costs dearly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><b>Another moral:</b> Apply logic to this grim story, and you will ascertain that it took place many years ago. No husband of our age would be so terrible as to demand the impossible of his wife, nor would he be such a jealous malcontent. For, whatever the color of her husband&#8217;s beard, the wife of today will let him know who the master is.</p>
<p>—neither of which properly gets at the heart of the story’s true horror. In fact, they almost appear to deliberately, laughably miss the story’s monstrosity.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that these morals serve as powerful mirrors for women’s actual relationships with the world: how we are steeped in a culture of rape and violence and death; how, if we resist, we are punished; how, even if we punish ourselves, we are mocked and blamed. And these mirrors are not (just) historical, not vague and old-timey and how it used to be. They are mirrors of here, now, today.</p>
<p>The fairy tale usually plays this element straight, of course, but that makes them virtual playgrounds for feminist writers; all we have to do is pick a story up and turn it askance.</p>
<p><b>The motif of the green ribbon, coupled with the themes of transgressive desire and secret knowledge, reminded me of Angela Carter&#8217;s short story &#8220;The Bloody Chamber&#8221; (a variation on Bluebeard in which the protagonist is gifted a red ribbon by her betrothed—a ribbon that prefigures the way he wants to kill her). Are you familiar with this story? Has Angela Carter inspired your work? What other writers and storytellers have influenced you?</b></p>
<p>Ah, yes. “A choker of rubies, two inches wide, like an extraordinarily precious slit throat… the flashing crimson jewels… bright as arterial blood.” That image is so vivid and terrible and beautiful. I do love Angela Carter’s work very much, but I came to her a bit later that one might expect. My literary education was sort of fragmented and weird; it was almost entirely self-directed (neither of my parents were big readers; I didn’t major in literature in college) and thus contained large gaps that I’ve only recently amended.</p>
<p>For example, I once wrote a story that an entire workshop identified as heavily influenced by Shirley Jackson. At first, I was confused by this comment, because I hadn’t read a stitch of Shirley Jackson beyond “The Lottery” in high school. But what I later concluded was that I’d read a lot of writers who were influenced by Shirley Jackson; so I was getting her fragmented, filtered influence.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I have read and am obsessed with Angela Carter and Shirley Jackson both. Other writers who influence my work: Patricia Highsmith, Jane Bowles, Muriel Sparks, Kelly Link, Karen Russell, Yoko Ogawa, Kazuo Ishiguro, Gloria Naylor, Gabriel García Márquez, Nicholson Baker, Kevin Brockmeier, Michelle Huneven, Michel Faber, Joyce Carol Oates, Helen Oyeyemi, Ann Patchett, Virginia Woolf, Jeanette Winterson, Sarah Waters, Michael Chabon, Alissa Nutting, Andrea Barrett, Chris Adrian, Ray Bradbury… I could go on forever.</p>
<p><b>“The Husband Stitch” is peppered with instructions that tell the reader how to share the story out loud, should they want to do so. These instructions gesture at traditions of oral storytelling. Why did you decide to include these instructions? What do you think they bring to &#8220;The Husband Stitch&#8221;? </b></p>
<p>When I was a Girl Scout, we’d go on this annual autumn camping trip in the Pocono Mountains. I sort of loved and hated it—I hated how cold and dark it was. I hated bugs. I hated the latrine. But I was enamored with the campfire—telling stories around it, eating food cooked in it, throwing various objects into it to see how they burned. (My favorite: a half-filled Dixie cup, which immediately burned down to the water line. Then the wax on the exterior blistered, and the contents bubbled and boiled for what seemed like forever, burned off, and then the entire thing was consumed by the flames.)</p>
<p>I was a really weird kid, and didn’t get along with the girls my age. But I was a good storyteller—theatrical, dramatic, effusive—and I loved telling tales around the campfire. So the first time I read the <i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i> series—which included a story where a ghost’s question, “Who’s got my money? Whoooo? Whoooo?” is followed by instructions for the storyteller to grab someone and yell “YOU’VE GOT IT!”—I became obsessed with the idea of the story crossing over into the real world. Which I did, the next chance I got. It was exactly as fun and exciting as I’d imagined. (And, bonus, I got to make a fellow Girl Scout cry. An artist is born!)</p>
<p>So of course, as I was working on “The Husband Stitch,” I got the idea to fold in warped narrative instructions. It does all kinds of interesting work: breaks down the wall between the story and the reader, invokes a tradition of oral storytelling, reinforces the story’s danger as real and literal, enables further commentary on gender, and is also just plain fun.</p>
<p>After I published “The Husband Stitch,” I received a bit of fan mail in which the writer told me that they had read this passage:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;">(If you are reading this story out loud, move aside the curtain to illustrate this final point to your listeners. It’ll be raining, I promise.)</p>
<p>And then felt compelled to push aside their living room curtain. And it was raining. And it blew their mind. Knowing that has happened <i>even once</i> fills me with incomprehensible amounts of joy.</p>
