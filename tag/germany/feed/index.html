<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>In 2014, when I began studying fairy tales, I came across Pauline Greenhill&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/41388863?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">&#8220;&#8216;Fitcher&#8217;s [Queer] Bird&#8217;: A Fairy-Tale Heroine and Her Avatars,&#8221;</a>  an academic article that offers a queer reading of <a href="http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/bluebeard/stories/fitchersbird.html">&#8220;Fitcher&#8217;s Bird,&#8221;</a> my favorite Grimm fairy tale. The article has deeply influenced my thinking and writing on fairy tales and so I was thrilled when, after sending off an email to Greenhill, she agreed to an interview.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Greenhill is Professor of Women’s and Gender Studies at the University of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

She has fairy-tale research published in </em>Feral Feminisms; Law, Culture and the Humanities; Marvels &amp; Tales; Narrative Culture; Studies in European Cinema; <em>and </em>Theoretical Criminology<em> among others.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>There&#8217;s a storied tradition of studying fairy tales through a feminist lens, but you take that work further, examining queerness in fairy tales. How did you find your way into this field of research?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Absolutely my queer/trans research is an extension of my feminist research! But my route to queer and trans fairy tales was circuitous. I started a masters in Folklore at Memorial University in St. John’s, Newfoundland in 1977. At the time, and to a sad extent now, the cool kids avoided traditionally recognised forms of folklore like ballads and fairy tales. Trying to be one of them, I did my masters thesis on family photography.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, when I got to the University of Texas at Austin in 1981, where I did my PhD, I worked with Roger deV. Renwick, a ballad and folk song scholar who has always been an advocate for studying traditional genres (see e.g. Renwick 1980 and 2009). So for my PhD dissertation on folk poetry in Ontario under Roger’s supervision, I was looking for the old in the new, as it were (Greenhill 1989).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After five years teaching Canadian Studies at the University of Waterloo, I came to the University of Winnipeg’s (then) Women’s Studies program in 1991. (We’re now a Department with six full time faculty and we’ve included “and Gender.”) At the time I was working on Newfoundland ballads about women who dress as men to follow their lovers or seek adventure as sailors, soldiers, or robbers. You can listen to one example <a href="http://tidido.com/a35184374041547/al55f091c6a5f39075733cc084/t55f091c7a5f39075733cc127">here</a>, sung by the fabulous Newfoundland traditional source singer Anita Best on the compilation album <i>Bristol’s Hope&#8211;Lately Come Over</i>. Hitherto folklorists’ readings assumed that these songs were about men and their experiences, and my feminist reading asserted that they were also about women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-540"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, when I talked to my undergraduate feminist theory class, telling them my idea that these songs expressed possibilities for women to control their own libidinal and reproductive economy (that is, to choose their own sex partners/husbands rather than having the partner chosen by their father as is most common in ballads), the students pointed out alternatives to my heteronormative interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Specifically, I didn’t take into account the fact that these songs often circled around the drama of a man declaring love for and/or suggesting sex with the cross dresser, apparently thinking she was male; or a woman declaring love and/or suggesting sex, unaware that she was attracted to a woman. Following the students’ lead, my first queering of traditional culture ventured that these ballads were (also) about same-sex attraction (Greenhill 1995). I have since continued to queer, and later to explore transgender expression in, traditional ballads (Greenhill 2014).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fairy tales entered the mix when I invited my friend, colleague, and co-conspirator in feminist and queer folklore Kay Turner to teach an intensive feminist folklore course at the University of Winnipeg in 1997. Kay decided to offer a few classes on the Grimms’ fairy tales, and again our fabulous Women’s Studies students were influential! They read the stories anew, reflecting upon them from their own queer locations. Kay and I were fascinated and resolved to do a book incorporating these interpretations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Transgressive Tales: Queering the Grimms </i>(Turner and Greenhill 2012) was 15 years in the making. Part of the problem was the difficulty of finding folklorists in the late 1990s who were willing to venture a queer reading of traditional fairy tales! Then, just as we were getting ready to finalise our plans, 9/11 happened. Kay was working as the folklorist for the Brooklyn Arts Council and turned all her attention toward documenting and recording people’s personal and aesthetic responses. By the middle of the decade, I was despairing of our chances of ever getting the book going, so I submitted my paper on “Fitcher’s (Queer) Bird” (ATU 311) to <i>Marvels &amp; Tales</i>, and they accepted it (2008).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, Kay and I resolved that we had to complete that transgressing! We proposed <i>Transgressive Tales </i>to Wayne State University Press’s Series in Fairy Tale Studies and they accepted. With a combination of work from seasoned scholars and from students, we looked at some literary rewritings, but also at traditional stories. For my own contribution, I managed to sneak in a Canadian fairy tale&#8211;“Peg Bearskin” in Newfoundland and “La Poiluse” in Francophone northern Ontario&#8211;about a gutsy, masculine-looking and -acting young woman who saves her sisters, seeks adventures and impossible tasks, and eventually marries a prince and magically transforms (herself) into a more feminine presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think reading these archetypal stories through a queer lens is important?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I like to use the insights of film theorist Alexander Doty on “queering” cinema, because they apply to nearly everything else also. The concept of queering too often “implies taking a thing that is straight and doing something to it” (2000, 2). Doty points out that heterosexual readings are conventionally presumed to be intrinsic, where queer and trans readings, then, must necessarily be taking an already-straight text and rendering it queer&#8211;an additive process, a reading-into, a twisting. Doty disagrees with that perspective, and so do I. We presume that texts have no essential sex, gender, or sexuality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certainly a lot of fairy tales look superficially straight (especially as redacted by those who bring their Christian, heteronormative perspectives, like the Brothers Grimm). Many focus on heterosexual marriage&#8211;either as an ending for men or as the beginning of women’s troubles! (discussed by Holbek 1987). However, sometimes one can be absolutely flabbergasted by how close to the surface queerness is; a lot of fairy tales really work well to undermine heteronormative presumptions. To quote Lewis Seifert, one of the first American scholars to start outing fairy tales, in his introduction to the recent special issue of <i>Marvels &amp; Tales</i>, called “Queer(ing) Fairy Tales,” a lot of times we find “erotic innuendo hiding in plain sight” (2015, 17)&#8211;and, I would add, queer and trans content similarly hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How could I NOT have seen the gay/lesbian/trans elements in those cross-dressing ballads? Because everything I’d learned growing up straight, and being intellectually formed in the discipline of folklore in the 1970s and 1980s, taught me to simply gloss over them! How can we NOT see a fairy tale type called “The Shift of Sex” (ATU 514), in which a woman transforms into man, as being about transgender expression (Greenhill and Anderson-Grégoire 2014)? What’s NOT queer about a story about a boy born half human, half hedgehog, who rides off on his shod cock (Greenhill 2014a)? Why should pointing out lesbian elements in a story like Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Snow Queen”&#8211;like Little Robber Girl kissing and sleeping with Gerda, so thoroughly overplayed especially in male directors’ live action films of the tale (Greenhill 2015)&#8211;seem anything other than obvious? In part because we’re taught that fairy tales are for kids, who are of course (wrongly!) presumed to be sexuality-free, its queer/trans content (presumed X-rated) seems invisible/impossible! And because, as Doty pointed out, the presumption that everyone and everything is always heterosexual prevails. But once you start looking&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your favorite fairy tale and why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> I confess to being a bit fickle in my fairy-tale loves. When I was working on “Fitcher’s Bird,” I was smitten. Then “Peg Bearskin/La Poiluse” called me, and “The Shift of Sex,” and “Hans My Hedgehog” (ATU 411). Lately in my fairy-tale film research I’ve branched out to include literary fairy tales, and I was watching and writing about cinema based on Andersen’s “The Snow Queen.” I was fascinated by the differences I saw between male directors’ readings of the story and the sexualities involved, and those of four (feminist) women directors (Greenhill 2016).</p>
<p>But the only fairy tale I actually tell&#8211;teaching is my usual performance&#8211;is a version of “The Robber Bridegroom” (ATU 955). I first heard it told by The Folktellers at the <a href="http://winnipegfolkfestival.ca/folk-fest/">Winnipeg Folk Festival</a>, a long time ago. There’s so much to love in that story. It’s a thriller&#8211;the story-within-a-story that the hero/ine uses to save themself; the triple incremental repetition “Be bold!” “Be bold, be bold!” “Be bold, be bold, but not so bold, lest that your heart’s blood should run cold.” I so appreciate the horror moments in fairy tales&#8211;especially when, as in “Fitcher’s Bird,” “Peg Bearskin,” “The Shift of Sex,” and of course “The Robber Bridegroom,” the sister, usually the younger sister, like me, eventually prevails.</p>
<p><strong>What have you been working on recently?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My colleagues Jill Terry Rudy, Naomi Hamer, Lauren Bosc and I are co-editing the<i> Routledge Companion to Fairy-Tale Cultures and Media</i>. I’ve promised a monograph called <i>Species of Magic and Wonder: Transgender, Transbiology, and Transformation in Fairy-Tale Media </i>to the Wayne State University Press Series in Fairy-Tale Studies. My colleagues Martin Lovelace, Anita Best and I are doing <i>“The Maid in the Thick of the Well”: Gender and the Magic Tales of Alice Lannon and Pius Power Senior</i>, a book on the ten magic tales collected from two Newfoundland source tellers. I’ve applied for a grant to do more on justice issues and fairy-tale media with Canadian and international colleagues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://iftf.uwinnipeg.ca/">The International Fairy-Tale Filmography online</a> needs constant updating. And I want to do more on two films: <i>Celestial Clockwork </i>(directed by Fina Torres, 1995), a lesbian/gay/queer transnational version of “Cinderella” (ATU 510A) about a Venezuelan mezzo-soprano in Paris trying to get the lead role in a film of Rossini’s <i>La Cenerentola</i>; and<i> The Fall</i> (directed by Tarsem Singh, 2006), another story-in-story story which explores storytelling and is visually amazing, having been filmed in more than 20 countries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m hoping to do more participant-observation on film sites with the fabulous women from <a href="http://www.redczarina.com/">Red Czarina</a>. Director Danishka Esterhazy welcomed a student research assistant and me to the set of <a href="http://www.hg-movie.com/"><i>H &amp; G </i></a>, a “Hansel and Gretel” (ATU 327A) film centring on Winnipeg and the surrounding countryside. It was a fantastic experience to see a movie being made. Danishka is in post-production on <i>The Singing Bones</i>, based on Francesca Lia Block’s “Beauty and the Beast” (ATU 425C) short story called “Bones.” Rebecca Gibson will be directing “Jane Garbage,” a modern “Cinderella” story. And check out Danishka’s earlier fairy tale films, <a href="http://www.danishkaesterhazy.com/portfolio/the-snow-queen/"><i>The Snow Queen </i></a>and <a href="http://www.danishkaesterhazy.com/portfolio/the-red-hood/">The Red Hood</a>&#8211;a riff on “Little Red Riding Hood” (ATU 333).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So much has been done on film since Sidney Eve Matrix and I did <i>Fairy Tale Films: Visions of Ambiguity </i>(2010) and Jack Zipes’s <i>The Enchanted Screen: The Unknown History of Fairy Tale Films </i>(2011) came out. (I have to give a shout out to Jack who has been an amazing supporter, mentor, and collaborator.  Thanks, Jack!) And many new fairy-tale films have come out, which I’m dying to share with the wonderful Women’s and Gender Studies students&#8211;and of course all the other students&#8211;at the University of Winnipeg. I’m hoping to teach a fairy-tale film course in Fall 2017 and screen some films I’ve encountered recently as well as some old favourites. My students loved <i>The Wolves of Kromer </i>(directed by Will Gould, 1998), a sweet film using “Little Red Riding Hood” to reflect on homophobia. And of course, all the cool new theory and analysis, including Anne Duggan’s (2013) work on Jacques Demy’s fairy tale films and Cristina Bacchilega’s (2013) de-colonising reflection on the transnational fairy tale web.</p>

<p>Popular culture reviews of new fairy-tale movies or television shows frequently note, with authority, that old fairy tales had a cruelty to them that has been “sanitized” since. I challenge that notion. Cruelty has been alive and well in American fairy tales for a long time.</p>
<p>Visit your local library and look for a copy of an illustrated version of “Hansel and Gretel.” In just about every variation you’ll find, the parents send their children out to the woods where the parents believe they are certain to perish. After some time wandering, the children stumble upon a witch’s cottage decorated with cookies and candy — perhaps they are hallucinating this, which starvation can incline one to do — but, whether it’s real or not, in their lightheaded condition (or perhaps desperation), they nibble the house, enter when they are invited to do so, and, drat — geez, these kids aren’t too bright, but they are super hungry and perhaps, good lord, altruistic — in any case, the boy Hansel is locked in a shed by a witch with absolutely no apparent supernatural powers at all. This red-eyed (hungover? sad?) witch proceeds to try to fatten Hansel up while verbally abusing Gretel, employed doing chores. Eventually, in just about every version under the sun, the “clever” children outsmart the witch: Hansel holds out a bone pretending it is his finger, and thus avoids being eaten; Gretel shoves the witch into the oven. They return home. The end!</p>
<p>Child abandonment, child abuse, murder — albeit self defense, but by a child, incinerating an old woman alive! — well this is just so, you know, sentimental and innocent. So sanitized. Thank goodness we’ve restored this stupid, light-hearted story to its dark ways.</p>
<p>Or have we?</p>
<p>Just under a hundred years ago — a blink of the eye — <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/29/wanda-gag-grimm-tales/">Wanda Gag’s 1920s version</a> ends with this flourish:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Sing every one,</em><br />
<em> My story is done,</em><br />
<em> And look! round the house</em><br />
<em> There runs a little mouse</em><br />
<em> He that can catch her before she scamps in</em><br />
<em>  May make himself a very very large cap out of her skin.</em></p>
<p>I don’t understand how anyone can read this as sanitized. I don’t understand when people fail to see the cruelty in life, or in art — which doesn’t mean there is not also beauty.</p>
<p>Look. There is serious charm and menace to the Grimm fairy-tale form. These are really small words; they have the aura of a nursery song; and this is a tiny tale of evil predation. A little mouse — a girl-mouse, of course the little mouse is a her — is to be caught and skinned! And this little mouse, well, she seems to have quite magical powers, or offer them to her predators, because whoever catches her can make — what? <em>A very, very large cap from her skin.</em></p>
<p>I love Wanda Gag’s work. (She grew up in poverty in Minnesota, attended art school in New York City, and is author of one of the oddest, saddest, and most violent children’s books to have become wildly popular in America, Millions of Cats. Among other things that are haunting in this inky, strange story, millions of cats devour each other.)</p>
<p>Gag has terrific poetics. She ends her variation of “Hansel and Gretel” on the word skin —<em> skin</em>, that one-syllable word that starts with a hiss and ends on the word that begins the word “no.” This is how to give readers the shivers.</p>
<p>Growing up in a family haunted by genocide in Nazi times — in ways I would only discover in my 30s — Gag’s coda speaks volumes to me. I am not writing this essay about the aesthetics of cruelty. I am writing it about violence — in art and in life — that goes too often denied.</p>
<p>The Brothers Grimm stories, by my reading, resisted such ignorance and still resist ignorance in just about every retelling I’ve seen of “Hansel and Gretel,” even those that seek to remove details deemed overly dark for those littlest of eyes — and largest of feeling. These stories invite readers into a radical acceptance that human cruelty is a reality — and, thus, challenge readers to resist human cruelty at the same time. They also invite us to be open to beauty and to find peaceful homes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by E.C. Messer</em></p>
<p>Beset by the desire to identify and explain the effects of Poetry—his word for drama—upon his sensibilities, Aristotle explains the difference between tragedy and comedy this way: tragedy begins in order and ends in chaos; comedy begins in chaos and ends in order. The tragic fable of Hamlet, for example, shows the disintegration of the State; the comedic fable of Tartuffe the reinstatement of the nuclear family.</p>
<p>In the traditional fables and fairy stories of Western literature, there are no tragedies: the wicked are punished, the good rewarded. Benefits gained by the former and hardships suffered by the latter, in the interim, are of no consequence to the story’s driving force, its resolution. There are, however, many Aristotelian comedies to be found among these fabulist ranks.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://pinkmonkey.com/dl/library1/story023.pdf">A Tall Tale From Ditmarsh</a></em>, collected by the Brothers Grimm, is an ideal tiny, bizarre encapsulation of the impulse toward order. Its opening, “I want to tell you something,” implies monologue, from which dialogue originally emerged. At first it appears to be all chaos—neither comedy nor tragedy but farce, or, in modern terms, absurdism. Absurdism can be funny, funnier even than certain comedies, but it is not itself comedy. It’s laughing while Rome burns, sometimes laughing because Rome is burning.</p>
<p><em>Ditmarsh</em>, instead, is the kind of controlled madness that reinforces order: to consider the anvil and the millstone swimming across the Rhine acknowledges the existence of anvils, millstones, rivers that can be swum. More than that, it insinuates the whole domestic, quotidian world of tools to be hammered into useful shapes, grain to be ground into bread, and human mouths to consume it for sustenance.</p>
<p>The open-ended nature of pseudo-absurdism allows for infinite variation. Local household objects and native fauna may be substituted as the storyteller desires. In London the Thames might replace the Rhine, in Japan an usu for pounding mochi replaces the millstone, here in San Francisco a bicycle across the bay replaces sails across fields. Folk tales are fundamentally artisanal, but the result is the same: a Brechtian estrangement without which we would be unable to understand the most ordinary objects and behaviors.</p>
<p>And there’s even a catharsis, for those who require a catharsis: “Open the window so the lies can fly out.” Literally a release, a banishment, a moral exorcism that leaves the listener (reader) with truth—the ultimate order—restored. Unless the window won’t open.</p>

<p>Fairy tales are well known for their use of familiar tropes and motifs. The persecuted heroine, the animal helper, the three wishes, the unassailable tower. I thought it would be fun to show the interplay of motifs across different fairy tales by mapping the fairy tale world in the form of a traditional <em>Cluedo</em> board. Instead of the usual weapons (dagger, revolver, lead piping etc.) I would substitute a selection of familiar fairy tale objects. Namely: key, spinning wheel, ring, apple, scissors, needle and slippers. All of these are common, everyday objects, but when they appear in fairy tales they are often imbued with magical powers or significance.</p>
<p>In the game of <em>Cluedo</em>, different combinations can be created by selecting person, room and weapon. I wanted to create similar combinations of character, room and object. I kept the traditional <em>Cluedo</em> rooms, with the exception of Billiard Room, which I changed to Turret. The connection of each character to their respective room may be tentative, but it exists nonetheless. My aim was to have at least one character in each room, and at least two characters sharing the same object or motif. In each case, the object (apple, needle etc.) features somewhere in a version of that character’s tale.</p>
<p>One feature of <em>Cluedo</em> that always excited me as a child was the use of secret passages. Fairy tales, too, have secret portals leading to strange underworlds. So I marked each passageway on the board with an underground destination from a different fairy tale, to which it might lead.</p>
<p>We cannot forget that the original game of <em>Cluedo</em> centers on a murder. Death and murder feature in fairy tales, too. So I marked the spot where the Murder Cards would traditionally be placed with the name of that shadowy fairy tale character, Godfather Death.</p>
<p>The fairy tales I have used for this map are as follows. For the characters in the rooms: Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, Allerleirauh (The Coat of all Colours), Bearskin, The Almond Tree, Snow-White and Rose-Red, The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids, The Experienced Huntsman, The Six Swans, Rumpelstiltskin, Beauty and the Beast, Rapunzel, Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty), The Glass Coffin, and Snow White. And for the secret passages: The Shoes Which Were Danced to Pieces, The Blue Lamp, The Glass Coffin (again) and Frau Holle.</p>

<p>What must a boy lose to become a little bird? In “The Juniper Tree,” by the Brothers Grimm, the boy loses more than just his head and his life after he is murdered by his evil stepmother. All that fat and skin and tissue sliced up, made into stew, fed to his oblivious father. All that bone wrapped up in a silk scarf and deposited under the juniper tree by his grieving half-sister. Then the tree works its magic and the dead boy is transformed into a living bird, a singing bird, a busy bird, a vengeful bird. He is without human arms, hands, and fingers now that they are wings. His legs are tiny and his feet are missing toes. His bones are hollow and light. His lips are rigid beaks.</p>
<p>People lose huge chunks of self—limbs, organs, functionality, quality of life—to disease and trauma every day. The survivors learn to fly and sing in their remaining bodies. They rise and fall and rise again with new routines and augmentations. They do not, however, receive for their efforts the bird’s reward at the end of the fairy tale: upon crushing his stepmother with a millstone, he immediately transforms back into the living boy he once was.</p>
<p>Transformative rewards may be coming, though. Recent medical breakthroughs promise to give back what survivors have lost: 3D-printed windpipes and other organs infused with the patient’s own cells. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> Thought-controlled prosthetics. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[2]</a> Face transplants. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[3]</a> Rewritten genetic code to prevent and treat genetic diseases. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[4]</a> These and other emerging technologies arrive and improve so rapidly that we have to wonder where all of this is heading. For a few years yet, these technologies will only approximate what survivors have lost, but there may soon come a time when technology returns full functionality to the human body and imbues it with better-than-human capabilities and performance.</p>
<p>After a terrible accident, the protagonist in Sunny Moraine’s recent short story, “Love Letters to Things Lost and Gained,” grapples with a cutting-edge prosthetic arm, an arm that provides enhancements and capabilities the original did not have, an arm that may be sentient, an arm that may be seeking friendship. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[5]</a> When a medical breakthrough arrives that fully regrows lost biological limbs, the protagonist ponders the question “The Juniper Tree” never thought to ask: What must the little bird lose to become the boy again?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by Joyce Goldenstern</em></p>
<p>Folktale behavior often bewilders me, as does my own. My thoughts wander to trace hidden patterns, more easily discerned in folktales than in my own life. This morning, a tale opens with the death of a beautiful queen. Before the queen dies, she makes her husband promise not to remarry anyone who does not have hair as golden as her own. Has she forgotten that her own daughter has such hair? <em>Allerleiruh.</em></p>
<p><em>This afternoon, a tale opens with an old queen who has betrothed her daughter to a prince in a distant land. It is a tale of a long journey, of a true bride and of a chambermaid who takes the place of the true bride.</em> The Goose Girl.</p>
<p>Allerleiruh, distraught upon hearing of her father&#8217;s desire to marry her, gathers her wits to dissuade him. She makes an impossible demand. He must provide her with a cloak made of 1000 furs, one from each animal in the kingdom. Undaunted, the king presents his daughter with said cloak and sets a date for the wedding.</p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, the talking head of a slain horse reveals the chambermaid’s deception, so the prince decides to ask a fatal question at a feast. “How would you sentence a false bride?” the prince asks the chambermaid, his own false bride.</em></p>
<p>Allerleiruh chars her face and wraps herself in furs. She runs away to a forest where she sleeps night and day in a hollow trunk until finally a hunter, identified as “the king,” finds her. This reference to “king” is so jarring that once when I presented this tale to an adult seminar, many participants ended up thinking that it was indeed the father who had found his daughter. How startling that the tale does not proffer a “prince”—a royal title which would distinguish generations and relations more clearly. Yet, not clarifying can blur relationships in psychologically significant ways.</p>
<p>That Allerleiruh marries the “new” king who is confused with the old … That the chambermaid does not recognize her own crime and thus sentences herself to torture and cruel death…. Such predicaments attest to the human capacity to self-deceive and force me to ask, “What is obvious in my own behavior that I do not see?”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by Wren Awry</em></p>
<p>In Reserve, New Mexico, kids wait for the school bus inside of wood and wire mesh cages. They were built after Mexican grey wolves were re-introduced to the area in 1998 because, some say, the wolves were following children home from school. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> Mexican wolves seldom attack humans, and there are no recorded deaths at their paws. <a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> So, where does the fear come from? Environmentalists blame rancher propaganda and ranchers blame the wolves. I also blame wolves. Not the real, flesh-and fur-kind. I blame “stranger danger” wolves made of celluloid and sentences.</p>
<p>I imagine parents have stopped reading “Little Red Riding Hood” to children; they skip the scene where Belle is surrounded by snarling, yellow-eyed monsters in Disney’s <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>. They tell their children to look out for upright canines with deep tenors, who will urge them to “pick a few flowers for granny.” Wolves, we all know, blow houses down, so when the wind comes, kid,<em> please assume wolf-hiding position</em>. Lycanthropy <em>is not funny </em>here.</p>
<p>But there are other kinds of wolves, and other kinds of fears, in the European fairy-tale canon.</p>
<p>“What should happen to a mother who throws her sons to the wolves?” a prince asks his wife in “The Wolves,” a Bavarian tale. The princess mentions red-hot iron shoes, and is duly punished.</p>
<p>Before death, did the princess recall the two wolves that shaped her fate? The one snarling back at her, in the mirror, during a fit of jealousy; and the one she sent her seven newborn sons to, in hopes that the <em>canis lupus</em> would eat them (“Multiple births,” she had, unfortunately, just told her husband, “Is a sure sign of adultery”).</p>
<p>She does not know—will never know, though she might guess—that the prince ran in to the midwife bringing the infants to the wolf. That the prince intercepted, saved his sons, had them raised by a loyal subject. Perhaps he re-routed. But in my mind, he followed the same path. The wolf the princess hoped would eat her sons raised them instead. When they returned to the court eighteen years later, the boys were long-haired and lupine. <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>In the kid cages of Reserve, do students peer through the wire mesh to look for wolves in the piñion and juniper? And, if yes: out of fright, or desire? Some must spin daydreams out of their mothers’ worst fears; must long to join up with the wolves out there in the wild world.</p>
