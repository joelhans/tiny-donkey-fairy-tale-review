								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">by Murad Jalilov<a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic.jpg"><br />
<img class="wp-image-908 alignright" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic-261x300.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="343" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic-261x300.jpg 261w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic.jpg 555w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Growing up Goychay, Azerbaijan, I would always hear my grandmother telling tales of old, some more interesting than others. She always told them at night in her loud-yet-soothing voice. The ones that stuck out the most were the fairy tales that were meant to frighten, such as “Adamcil” (Man-Eater), a tale of a humanoid with long horns and claws, covered in fur, eating human corpses, and “Isah and Musah,” the tale of a bird that mimics the cries of two brothers lost in a forest. These tales had a certain eerie charm to them and always blended with the mysterious nature and sounds of the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the better ways of introducing the public to a new culture is through folklore, more specifically fairy tales. As an immigrant from Azerbaijan, I’ve seen the current trends in American society where diversity is being somewhat celebrated, despite the current political rhetoric. It made me realize that I have something of my own to bring into this country and to its culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Azerbaijan’s geographical position as a country between the Middle East and Europe, surrounded by countries such as Russia, Iran and Turkey, made it an ancient hub for cultural exchange, creating a relatively unique folklore. The story that reflects this the most is “The Tale of Malikmammad,” about a young prince who journeys into the Dark World and has to face creatures from European folklore, like ogres and dragons, and a creature from Turkic folklore called the Emerald Bird (Zumrud/Konrul). There are also Azerbaijani versions of western tales such as “Cinderella” (“Göyçək Fatma”) and “The Three Goats” (“Şəngülüm, Şüngülüm, Məngülüm”). There are also plenty of tales about animals, usually with human traits, such as “Trickster Goat,” which tells the story of a goat that outsmarted a bear, a wolf, and a fox.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, a very limited number of Azerbaijani fairy tales have been translated into English, one of them being “Jirtan: The Little Boy Who Fought Monsters,” published in <em>Azerbaijan International Magazine</em> in 1996. Beyond this example, it is almost impossible to find English translations for fairy tales in the language, even for those that are known well among the Azerbaijani people, and it’s a shame that so much folklore is lost behind the language barrier. Fortunately, the age of information has connected people from around the world, making it much easier for cultures to share their heritage online for all to read and translate. Other than websites dedicated to collecting fairy tales and folklore, for me personally the web makes it easier to stay in touch with my relatives in Azerbaijan on a much more frequent basis, which allows me to ask them for fairytales that have never been recorded online or in print.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is essential that these fairy tales are translated into English and introduced to the wider public to add the voice of a culture that has been silent for years. Unfortunately, there is little interest in literarily translating Azerbaijani literature into English among those who speak both languages, and there are even fewer people versed in creative writing in English on a college level. Azerbaijani fairy tales will bring new ideas and enrich the literature that is available in English. For this reason, I have been inspired to add the cultural artifacts I brought with me, in the form of fairy tales, to the ever-growing melting pot that is the US, through literary translation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Trickster Goat </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Translated by Murad Jalilov and N.K Valek</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once there was and once there wasn’t a group of people moving from the mountains to the plains. A Goat, a Calf, and a Sheep from the herds were in a hidden place eating grass and were not aware that their people were leaving them. When they raised their heads, however, their people were already gone. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Calf went to the Goat. “Brother Goat,” he cried, “the wolf is going to eat us! Please find us a way!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goat replied, “Let us find a hut and start living in it.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three of them agreed and started searching for a hut. Along the way, they found the pelt of a bear for the Calf, and pelt of wolf for the Goat and a pelt of fox for the Sheep to cover themselves with. After some more wandering, they finally found a hut and happily entered it, only to find a Bear, a Wolf, and a Fox having a chat.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bear spoke happily to the fox, “Grandfather Fox, please bring me a piece of wood.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fox brought a piece of wood from the corner. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bear put the wood on his chest and started singing, “Ring, my lute, ring: Today I ate a calf, and another fell down the chimney.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wolf took the wood from the Bear and sang, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a goat, and another one came to me willingly.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the Fox took the wood. “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a sheep and shall have another one!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing all this, the Goat told the Sheep, “Bring me a piece of wood.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sheep gave the Goat the piece of wood. The Goat put the wood on his chest and started singing, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a wolf, covered myself with its pelt, and I shall eat another one.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he gave the wood to the Calf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Calf took the wood and sang, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a bear, covered myself with its pelt, and I shall eat another one.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Calf gave the wood to the Sheep, who also sang, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a fox, covered myself with its pelt, and I shall eat another one.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Fox heard this, it ran out the hut, followed by the Wolf and the Bear. The Goat told his comrades, “This trick saved our lives. They will have time to think while they run and they will return to eat us. Let’s run somewhere else.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them agreed to leave. They wandered for a little, and they stumbled upon a rock. They decided to climb the rock and lie down there. Meanwhile the Bear, the Wolf and the Fox were still running. Suddenly the Wolf spoke up, “Hey, a goat, a calf and a sheep won’t be able to eat us. They tricked us. Let’s go back and eat them.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they returned to the hut, they found it to be abandoned. They followed the track of the three animals and stumbled upon a rock. They saw the Goat, the Calf and the Sheep on top of the rock. Once the Calf noticed the Bear’s scary gaze, he got frightened, slipped and fell from the rock. The Goat seeing this yelled as loud as he could:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Brother Calf, go get the bear, and we’ll take care of the wolf and the fox!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing this, the Fox ran off, and the Wolf and the Bear followed. The three herd friends laughed for a while together. Later all three of them found a way to the plains and rejoined the herds of their people. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>by Psyche Z. Ready</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have always loved stories of cross-dressing heroines. It’s a familiar trope in literature, legends, and fairy tales: a woman dresses as a man to solve some problem, or to save the day. In her male guise, she is strong, brave, skillful, and clever.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> At the end of the tale, however, when the conflict is resolved, she usually puts back on her apron and returns home. In many variants, home is a controlling father, a bullying brother, or a drunken husband. In my search for variants, I found another tale type that ends differently. In “The Shift of Sex,” or ATU 514<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[2]</a> , the heroine does not go home after her adventures, but stays in her male disguise and eventually <i>becomes </i>a man. Most variants follow this narrative (I’ve used the gendered pronouns given in most sources):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>An elderly father is asked by the king to enter military service. Because he is old and has no sons, his daughter dresses in his clothes, borrows his horse, and joins for him. With the help of her magical horse, she excels at all she does. She quickly becomes the king’s favorite soldier, and his daughter falls in love with her. When the community begins to doubt that she is a man, they set her on impossible quests that she completes easily. Her final battle is with a demon or witch, who curses her with their dying breath: “If you are a man, be now a woman! If you are a woman, be now a man.” The hero returns home to his castle where he is celebrated, his wife rejoices, and they all live happily ever after.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Shift of Sex” is a very old and widespread tale: it has been told for at least two, possibly three thousand years<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[3]</a> , across Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas. There are at least twenty-six variants in English today, and I have spent the last year researching them. In <a href="http://mars.gmu.edu/bitstream/handle/1920/10314/Ready_thesis_2016.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">my academic work</a> on the subject, I argue that this tale type was historically a space to express frustrations at the limitations of the female gender. Today, however, this tale has the potential to hold space for a broader expression of gender identity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-784 aligncenter" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2.jpg" alt="" width="407" height="479" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2.jpg 522w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2-255x300.jpg 255w" sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An issue that some modern readers have with this tale is that, while it begins as a queer romance between two women, it ends with what feels like a return to heteronormativity. When the protagonist changes gender, the couple becomes heterosexual. Some readers interpret the story as a narrative message that says a happy ending for two women in love is impossible. The story is read as a <i>condemnation</i> of queer love. I read this story, however, not as a queer romance gone hetero, but as a trans love story with a happy ending. I would not argue that audiences thousands of years ago saw the protagonist in this tale as transgender<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[4]</a>, but present-day audiences certainly can.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the many variants of this tale type, there are differences in narrative structure, tone, and detail, but the one element that is present in each is the happy ending: the princess is overjoyed that her partner has changed gender, and she and the royal family accept him, and they live happily ever after. Historically, our literary and popular narratives are lousy with stories of characters who transgress gender roles or heteronormativity and suffer for it; even contemporary stories with queer and non-binary characters <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays">kill them off</a>, or <a href="http://www.glaad.org/publications/victims-or-villains-examining-ten-years-transgender-images-television">depict them as monsters</a>. The message spoken by these narratives is clear: any transgression of traditional gender and sexuality will be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While we as a culture continue the struggle to create happy endings for transgressive and transgender characters in our own popular literature, we can take heart that there is a folktale that has been told and retold for thousands of years with a transgressive, cross-dressing, sex-changing protagonist who is not punished, but rewarded for their bravery, skill, and strength with wealth, marriage, and a happy life.</p>

Folklorists Pauline Greenhill and Emilie Anderson-Grégoire discuss ATU 514 at length in Unsettling Assumptions: Tradition, Gender, Drag.</p>
<p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1">[3]</a> A variant appears in Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>, which dates to 8 CE; another in the Indian <em>Mahabarata</em>, which originates in the 7th or 8th century BCE; and also “Alimbeglanya” in the Ossetian Nart Sagas, which were compiled around 2,000 BCE.</p>
<p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1">[4]</a> These tales were told long ago and in disparate regions with notions of sex, gender, and gender identity unquestionably different from our own; to apply a contemporary understanding of gender identity to these cultures is a form of conceptual colonialism.</p>

<p>Popular culture reviews of new fairy-tale movies or television shows frequently note, with authority, that old fairy tales had a cruelty to them that has been “sanitized” since. I challenge that notion. Cruelty has been alive and well in American fairy tales for a long time.</p>
<p>Visit your local library and look for a copy of an illustrated version of “Hansel and Gretel.” In just about every variation you’ll find, the parents send their children out to the woods where the parents believe they are certain to perish. After some time wandering, the children stumble upon a witch’s cottage decorated with cookies and candy — perhaps they are hallucinating this, which starvation can incline one to do — but, whether it’s real or not, in their lightheaded condition (or perhaps desperation), they nibble the house, enter when they are invited to do so, and, drat — geez, these kids aren’t too bright, but they are super hungry and perhaps, good lord, altruistic — in any case, the boy Hansel is locked in a shed by a witch with absolutely no apparent supernatural powers at all. This red-eyed (hungover? sad?) witch proceeds to try to fatten Hansel up while verbally abusing Gretel, employed doing chores. Eventually, in just about every version under the sun, the “clever” children outsmart the witch: Hansel holds out a bone pretending it is his finger, and thus avoids being eaten; Gretel shoves the witch into the oven. They return home. The end!</p>
<p>Child abandonment, child abuse, murder — albeit self defense, but by a child, incinerating an old woman alive! — well this is just so, you know, sentimental and innocent. So sanitized. Thank goodness we’ve restored this stupid, light-hearted story to its dark ways.</p>
<p>Or have we?</p>
<p>Just under a hundred years ago — a blink of the eye — <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/29/wanda-gag-grimm-tales/">Wanda Gag’s 1920s version</a> ends with this flourish:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Sing every one,</em><br />
<em> My story is done,</em><br />
<em> And look! round the house</em><br />
<em> There runs a little mouse</em><br />
<em> He that can catch her before she scamps in</em><br />
<em>  May make himself a very very large cap out of her skin.</em></p>
<p>I don’t understand how anyone can read this as sanitized. I don’t understand when people fail to see the cruelty in life, or in art — which doesn’t mean there is not also beauty.</p>
<p>Look. There is serious charm and menace to the Grimm fairy-tale form. These are really small words; they have the aura of a nursery song; and this is a tiny tale of evil predation. A little mouse — a girl-mouse, of course the little mouse is a her — is to be caught and skinned! And this little mouse, well, she seems to have quite magical powers, or offer them to her predators, because whoever catches her can make — what? <em>A very, very large cap from her skin.</em></p>
<p>I love Wanda Gag’s work. (She grew up in poverty in Minnesota, attended art school in New York City, and is author of one of the oddest, saddest, and most violent children’s books to have become wildly popular in America, Millions of Cats. Among other things that are haunting in this inky, strange story, millions of cats devour each other.)</p>
<p>Gag has terrific poetics. She ends her variation of “Hansel and Gretel” on the word skin —<em> skin</em>, that one-syllable word that starts with a hiss and ends on the word that begins the word “no.” This is how to give readers the shivers.</p>
<p>Growing up in a family haunted by genocide in Nazi times — in ways I would only discover in my 30s — Gag’s coda speaks volumes to me. I am not writing this essay about the aesthetics of cruelty. I am writing it about violence — in art and in life — that goes too often denied.</p>
<p>The Brothers Grimm stories, by my reading, resisted such ignorance and still resist ignorance in just about every retelling I’ve seen of “Hansel and Gretel,” even those that seek to remove details deemed overly dark for those littlest of eyes — and largest of feeling. These stories invite readers into a radical acceptance that human cruelty is a reality — and, thus, challenge readers to resist human cruelty at the same time. They also invite us to be open to beauty and to find peaceful homes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/nunda.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-318"><img class=" wp-image-318 alignright" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/nunda.jpg" alt="nunda" width="290" height="473" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/nunda.jpg 368w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/nunda-184x300.jpg 184w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></a>So it flew up higher still—so high that the earth shone like one of the other stars.</em><br />
<em> &#8216;How much of you will be left if you fall from here?&#8217; asked the bird.</em><br />
<em> &#8216;If I die, I die,&#8217; said the boy, &#8216;but I will not leave you.&#8217;</em></p>
<p>The Swahili fairy tale, “The Nunda, Eater of People,” is the story of a boy and figs, and a sultan, and a bird. It also contains, perhaps, the most extreme of what Max Lüthi, preeminent fairy-tale scholar and critic, would call a “blind motif”: an element not made use of, narratively, once it is introduced. An element whose purpose is only disappear. Think of a protagonist and their two older brothers, who are never referred to after their introduction, and yet are not removed by the author—the blind motif is the anti-Chekhov’s gun, a red herring gone amok. In “The Nunda,” our protagonist holds onto the bird until it relents and offers one of its feathers; in an emergency, the boy can burn the feather, and the bird will rescue him.</p>
<p>At the moment of transaction, the story is only halfway done: the latter half revolves around a murderous cat and our protagonist’s mission to kill it, with no more mention of the feather. The story seems to laugh in the face of expectations, the call and response. The idea of what goes up must come down. We enter the realm of the dreaded vague: For all we know, the feather has fallen out of the youngest&#8217;s pocket, been blown by the wind into some forgotten corner of his abode. For all we know, the feather has been pickpocketed by a neighboring child and put beneath a pillow to be forgotten. For all we know, the feather is kept until the boy becomes an old man who has never saw reason to flee anything.</p>
<p>That we do not dwell on how this bird carries the boy into space is beautiful. That in the quote above the bird asks not about dying in the fall, but having only a remainder of a body, is beautiful. That none of this is explained is beautiful. Can we truly not accept a gun that does not fire by the curtain’s fall? Are we really that against the motif that blinds, or refuses to be congruous? The sultan was mentioned in the first sentence here and never did return. Was he missed, or was his being forgotten something better?</p>
<p>“The Nunda,” as with all stories, could have offered us an answer as to the boy and his feather, but isn’t it better that we can leave ourselves with just one of a thousand better visions? For all we know, the boy burns his feather a decade after killing the Nunda, and only because he feels like taking a wing-borne joyride over Nalubaale and all its freshwater, the source of the thing many others call the Nile.</p>
