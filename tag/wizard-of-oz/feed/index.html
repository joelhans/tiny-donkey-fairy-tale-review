<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That summer thirteen funnel clouds touch down in televised wheat fields. Like Japanese ghosts, pale and legless. At the diner, my mother murmurs <i>doomsday</i>. The waitress asks if we&#8217;re ready. Onscreen, the Doppler spreads fervent pixels. Birds ascend. Dogs grow feral and flee towards higher ground. A woman weeps, pulls her hair over herself and shuts it like a tent. One can always be closer. Louder, bolder. Referring to the endless salad bar, my mother says, <i>make sure you get your money&#8217;s worth</i>. Over a photograph of an open-faced turkey sandwich, my father, the Great Skeptic, admits he believes in ghosts. He says, <i>just floating</i>, and wiggles his fingers. There his grandfather hangs in the corner. There grey twisters sucker across the gray prairie, leaving gray gutters in the gray earth. My father is, at that moment, dying. We continue eating. White tumors silently expand within. Black lesions spot the torso. The afterimage begins its beamed course. Our ears peel for echo. The dead leave gray gutters in the gray earth. Meteorologists prep for more. Sirens, cellars, <i>get down, stay down</i>. We say, <i>no, we need more time. </i>Everything is gray, white or black. Everything is mapped. Isn&#8217;t it. We turn towards the television again, then again. By definition, to be this you must touch both the sky and the ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>II</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the eye of the cyclone spring wild forms: forty wolves and forty crows and a black clot of bees. The phrase <i>all hell breaks loose. </i>Our hunger is singular, as though we have not eaten all our lives. Muzzles to the earth. So thin our bones perform a shadow play, black rabbits and black eels, skitter across the boney chest, ribbon through the hipbone, respectively. Huffing in strange sync. Eventually, one animal wears another. Snorting like a funnel cloud all through the night. Flush with release, we leap and leap. Poppies open their bloody mouths below, fluster vibrant pollen, mouth <i>O O O</i>.  O our blood sings its stupid loops. O our blood runs rampant through the jaw. Define sated. Here at the earth&#8217;s edge. Tangled in the devil&#8217;s antlers. Suspended in mid-air. What we hunger for should not be eaten. What we hunger for is lost to itself, is missing vital parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>III</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You should show greater respect, greater longing. You should visit more often. You should go home, come home. I choose British, I choose woman, every time I load the GPS. Still I fear that I will lose my way. Let&#8217;s be frank. I am not the one who is missing. Is it greener where you&#8217;ve gone, as they insist. Is your grandfather on display. What about the dogs we put down. Here I often sleep with the light on. I sleepwalk nightly. I sleep-eat breakfast and sleep-clean the countertops. Polished as an ax, I stand prepared. Call it pole star, lighthouse, beacon, lamp, flashlight, light organ, lure. Whether you come from above or below or through. How do I make myself known. You should find your way home. Others have come as far, if you still believe that sort of thing.</p>
