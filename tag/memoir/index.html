		<p style="text-align: justify;">Growing up, you were shy. Or maybe you were short, you were fat, you had bad teeth. You had frizzy hair, you wet the bed, you spoke with a stammer. You slept with a stuffed toy â&#128;&#152;til you were twelve, or â&#128;&#152;til you were twenty, or â&#128;&#152;til your monthly blood ran out and you began soaking the bed with night sweats and hot flashes and Mississippi-wide rivers of regrets. Youâ&#128;&#153;re almost an old woman now. Love and transcendence have passed you by. Those fairy tales you were fed by Hollywood and MTV and Hans Christian Andersen as a child, and the ones you fed yourself to get by, through the loneliness of the school playground, through the long tick-tocking overthinking of the night, through the daily treacheries of life â&#128;&#147; they all lied.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-840" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed.jpg" alt="" width="735" height="651" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed.jpg 735w,https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed-300x266.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which fairy tale was it you always went back to, the one you believed in most? The one with the song saying someday your prince would come? Or the one where the funny-looking little duckling (you donâ&#128;&#153;t like to say â&#128;&#156;uglyâ&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#147; itâ&#128;&#153;s a word thatâ&#128;&#153;s been used against you so many times) turns into a stunner of a swan? Did you think that might be you one day? Did you really? All along, you should have paid more attention to the crone, the ogre, the unredeemed outcasts, the ones haunting the margins, or worse yet, the ordinary ones, the unmagical, the unnamed and underappreciated. Because these were your destiny â&#128;&#147; not the beautiful ones, not the princess and the swan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or maybe the fairy tales didnâ&#128;&#153;t lie. You just saw in them what you wanted, took what you needed. Beauty, hope, promises of happily ever after, some danger to make things interesting, some fear to cut through the dull of the everyday. You simply ignored the despair. Even though all fairy tales, and all life, is rife with it. Like that moment in <a href="http://hca.gilead.org.il/ugly_duc.html">Andersenâ&#128;&#153;s tale about the duckling</a>, when the bullied little bird welcomes the beauty of spring and a bevy of swans with pure, piercing heartache:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">â&#128;&#156;I will fly to those royal birds,â&#128;&#157; he exclaimed, â&#128;&#156;and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matterâ&#128;¦â&#128;&#157;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">Then he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans. The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">â&#128;&#156;Kill me,â&#128;&#157; said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the next moment the duckling sees his reflection in the water, sees a swan looking back â&#128;&#147; his transformed self, his true tribe, his happily ever after. I wonder though, if the duckling had seen no change, no beauty, no swan staring back at him in the water, could he still have survived? Would he still have come to know happiness, belonging, self-love?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I need to know, same as every once and for-all-time misfit. Is there magic after all in despair? Can there be beauty in forsaken hope, transcendence without transformation, belonging when youâ&#128;&#153;re the only one around to hear your own questions, a happy ending when the fairy tale, or life, or maybe yourself, is found so wanting?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Think back on the ones you paid too little attention to, while you were paying as little attention to the beauty in your worst and best self. The crone, the ogre, the marginal, the ordinary. The untransformed duckling. The resilient, the persisting, the interesting and astute, the ultimately self-accepting and wise. Lucky you â&#128;&#147; these were your destiny. The unbeautiful ones, who know how to make magic out of the most disappointing circumstances, to potion up an unbreakable spell of endurance out of yesterdayâ&#128;&#153;s cold pot of despair. Let them teach you to love whatever reflection stares back at you, to see the beauty in even a fantastically imperfect you.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a statue near the border of Nogales, Arizona of a small boy. Every time my mother, brother, and I would walk by sheâ&#128;&#153;d turn to us and say that if we misbehaved or did not follow her instructions we would become a statue just like that small boy. My mother was always aided by folk tales or myths to scare us into thinking that if we deliberately disobeyed her, consequences would arise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mother is from Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. Molded by a culture full of folk tales and old proverbs, she passed on generations of stories to my siblings and I. Â My mother shared the legends of El Cucuy, the Mexican boogeymann and El Chupacabra, a goat-like creature the size of a small bear–its spines reaching from its neck to the base of its tail–that haunts the desert. She also told me about La Llorona.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">La Llorona</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is told as a cautionary tale to children to make them behave properly. Different versions of the story are told depending on the region. Some say the story focuses on Maria, a woman so beautiful that all the men in her town attempted to woo her each time she walked by. Maria, with a sense of self absorption, believed she deserved the attention. She would flirt with the men but vowed only to marry the most handsome and wealthiest man she could find. The only problem interfering with her lifestyle? Her two sons. So she decided to drown them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other versions of the tale say Maria married a wealthy man and they were happy. She bore him two sons. After a time, the man would go away for long periods of time and when he returned, only focused on his sons. One day, he returned with another woman at his side and left again. Enraged, Maria drowned her two children in the river. Maria became deeply remorseful and wandered along the banks hoping her sons would return. It is said that when she finally died, her weeping spirit wandered the land, crying, â&#128;&#156;Â¡Ay, mis hijos!â&#128;&#157;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-822 size-full" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault.jpg 480w,https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day when I was five, my three siblings and I were playing a game of freeze tag on my grandmaâ&#128;&#153;s patio. Our dogs chased and barked at us. The daylight was quickly vanishing and the street lamps were turning on. As the sun set, my mother called out to us and yelled it was time to return inside. We didnâ&#128;&#153;t listen. She yelled out, â&#128;&#156;Â¡Si no regresan ya, los va a agarrar La Llorona!â&#128;&#157; which roughly translates to, â&#128;&#156;If you donâ&#128;&#153;t return now, La Llorona will come get you.â&#128;&#157; My brothers stopped playing and ran inside. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t understand who my mom was speaking of because I was the youngest and had not heard the tale. I stayed outside for another five minutes and when I decided to go back, I found the door was locked. My mom on the other side said it was too late and La Llorona coming. Panicking, I begged to go inside. She hesitated. I said I was sorry for not coming back when she asked. The door unlocked and I ran inside. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat on a rusty old stool as I listened to my mother explain the importance of La Llorona. A weeping women all dressed in a white dress and her face covered by a white veil. She wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t rest until she found her kids. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s when my mom uttered the word: â&#128;&#156;Unless…â&#128;&#157; I stared at her, tightening my eyebrows. â&#128;&#156;Unless she finds other children, children who misbehave, and takes them instead.â&#128;&#157; I felt my skin lose its smoothness and small bumps started forming from my forearm to my shoulder. â&#128;&#156;La Llorona will come as soon as the lights on the street start turning on. Make sure youâ&#128;&#153;re inside when the street lamps glow.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-753" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2.jpg" alt="" width="910" height="614" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2.jpg 910w,https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2-300x202.jpg 300w,https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2-768x518.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My motherâ&#128;&#153;s kitchen cupboards are stocked with ancestral memories; crammed with what may look like ordinary jars and cans, boxes and bottlesâ&#128;&#148;but I know better. <i>These are her hunger ghosts,</i> I think to myself every time I open the cupboards, <i>doppelgangers of old wounds and inherited hurts.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The same goes for the freezer and fridge, the fruit bowl, even the jar for cat treats. My mother hoards food. She consistently buys too much, as if sheâ&#128;&#153;s still cooking for a household of eight or preparing for a food shortage or a spell of famine. She overcooks too, long used to making large casseroles that needed to stretch into a couple daysâ&#128;&#153; worth of leftovers. My father and I have tried talking to her, telling her to scale back, that we cannot possibly eat everything before it spoils and itâ&#128;&#153;s a sin to waste food.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But I think she really is preparing for a famine, or reckoning with the haunting of one. My mother descends from the Famine Irish, the generation that left Ireland in the mid-19th century for their lives, escaping starvation and fever, mass death, and the devastation of centuries of British colonialism. Hunger is the reason sheâ&#128;&#153;s here, in America, and half the reason Iâ&#128;&#153;m here too, along with my brothers, sisters, and all my maternal cousins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Irish folk belief thereâ&#128;&#153;s a type of grass called <i>an fÃ©ar gortach</i>, the hungry grass. Some say itâ&#128;&#153;s a different shade than the green that famously carpets Ireland, more silver in color, or patchy and withered. Others say it looks like any other grass, and you only know youâ&#128;&#153;ve stepped on it too late, when a great hunger suddenly comes upon you and nothing can cure it save a bite of some bread tucked away in your pockets (if you had the forethought) or a bit of your own shoelace (if youâ&#128;&#153;re really stuck). Itâ&#128;&#153;s said hungry grass grows wherever a corpse has been laid down or someone has died. The belief predates <i>An Gorta MÃ³r</i> of the 1840s, the Great Hunger. But <i>an fÃ©ar gortach</i> took on a new, ghastly meaning then, in an era when famine victims were found in fields and on roadsides, a ring of green around their open, lifeless mouths after a last, desperate meal of grass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Irelandâ&#128;&#153;s potato crop failed and its people starved, its other crops were harvested and exported by the shipload to serve on British dinner tables and fill British bellies. At least a million Irish died during the Famine, their bodies buried in mass graves wherever their lives gave out. In a sense, all Irelandâ&#128;&#153;s green countryside turned to hungry grass, a landscape of want and loss, of lasting trauma and emptied beauty. At least another million emigrated, became refugees, exiles, Irish-Americans, Irish-Canadians, Irish-Australians, hyphenated people, diasporic, hungry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Growing up, Mom spoke often of her familyâ&#128;&#153;s history, sang and played us Irish folk songs, explained to us the Famine, dressed us in green on St. Patrickâ&#128;&#153;s Day. Maybe it seems a stretch to suggest my motherâ&#128;&#153;s food compulsions have anything to do with an event in another country her ancestors left <i>fadÃ³ fadÃ³</i>. But some events are simply too large, too traumatic not to eat into the blood, the DNA, the collective cultural memory of a people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Motherâ&#128;&#153;s ancestral memories transferred to all her children, but might have absorbed most deeply into me, her last-born child and the only one to go live in Ireland years later. I am the child whoâ&#128;&#153;s never married, never had children. Whoâ&#128;&#153;s struggled with her weight, eats when sheâ&#128;&#153;s not hungry, and bakes when sheâ&#128;&#153;s sad or simply bored. Who collects cats, books, and passport stamps like theyâ&#128;&#153;ll fill up some loss, some second-hand but deep-rooted want and need. The famished one, always looking for some patch of grass where the hunger finally makes sense.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Every story begins with a story that you already know: something that is entrenched in your core despite it seeming completely foreign at firstâ&#128;&#148;the moment when you realize that you dislike the bitter taste of almonds; the sight of your own blood as you dab at it with your thumbâ&#128;&#148;the scarlet seeping into the ridges of your fingerprints before you rinse your body of itself clear in the bathroom sink.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the edge of my bed, a bookshelf filled with hardcoversâ&#128;&#148;texts that I could call â&#128;&#156;mineâ&#128;&#157; in a way that children claim things; all things received as a gift; the ornate pages, the gold trim that I would scratch at with my fingernails if I hadnâ&#128;&#153;t already bitten them to flatness. The stories, too, were mine: girls and boys and frogs and toads rooted to my stomach, curving their way around the bumps in my spine, as if they had always been there, just beneath the surface, leaving their marks on the inside of my skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The games too, were mine, in a different way: whereas the stories of my youth were found within, as if they had been stitched into my core, the games were explosive in their momentsâ&#128;&#148;they burst into my world from the exterior, and it was my duty to capture those days sitting on a stained carpet in an upstairs hallway trying to make this other version of myself run fast enough that the boomerang would get lost amongst the rocks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These too, were stories that I already knew: of awakening in a land where all things are equal and the touch of a fleck of light could kill you where you stoodâ&#128;&#148;these stories of danger, or warning, of beware the outside, but push forward toward an unknown end and eat all of the fruit whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a time when I would have to shut the game off, but I could enter a different world through the pages at the foot of my bed, often scanning the same stories over and over before it was time to put my glasses on the nightstand and let all worlds blur. Some nights, when the room was too warm from the heat of all of the electronics, I could see the images of the parallax scrolling still engrained in the darkness, glowing a warm red, even when all of the lights were outâ&#128;&#148;a constant revisiting, as if I were the vacuum tube casting images against the blackened windows.</p>

		<style>
  span.highlight {background-color: yellow;}<br /></style><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I begin with a question: Why are goodbyes so absent in fairy tales?</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had no rest or peace until she set out secretly, and went forth into the wide world to trace out her brothers and set them free, let it cost what it might. </span><span class="highlight">She took nothing with her but a little ring belonging to her parents as a keepsake</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a loaf of bread against hunger, a little pitcher of water against thirst, and a little chair as a provision against weariness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now she went continually onwards, far, far to the very end of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â&#128;&#148; â&#128;&#156;The Seven Ravensâ&#128;&#157; <a href="#1">[1]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every story, even each of our own, involves a departure from our homes, and our parents. How this happens is different for everyone, but the ending is the same.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said goodbye to Madison, the place I was born, and to my favorite little woods in the city. I said goodbye to my mother, who cried as I packed inside the car with my wife and my dog and my cat [she cries every time I leave her, or she leaves me]. I said goodbye to my father [he always told me that if I didnâ&#128;&#153;t leave the place I was raised I would always regret it, and he was right].</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when his youngest daughter came to sit next to him and be questioned, she said, â&#128;&#156;These and all other blessings are from Allah.â&#128;&#157; Angered, her father said, â&#128;&#156;Since you place so little value on what I can do for you, go and discover how many are the blessings of Allah!â&#128;&#157;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl tied a few clothes into a kerchief and, trusting herself to Godâ&#128;&#153;s protection, stepped out of her fatherâ&#128;&#153;s house. </span><span class="highlight">She had no idea where to turn, so she walked in the direction that her face was pointing until she came to some ramshackle sheds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â&#128;&#148; â&#128;&#156;The Girl Who Spoke Jasmines and Liliesâ&#128;&#157; <a href="#2">[2]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the girl, we had a destination: Tucson, a 1,700-mile drive, fairy-tale in its oddities: a Kansas hail storm, a hundred eager dust devils whipping the New Mexico border.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fairy tale must leave out the goodbye as technique, as purposeful disconnect. It renders the world a little less real. Those who love fairy tales understand the idea of flatness: characters are unnamed, and receiving only an emotional silhouetting. Our dear Kate Bernheimer says fairy-tale characters â&#128;&#156;are not in psychological conflict.â&#128;&#157;<a href="#3">[3]</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â I donâ&#128;&#153;t think all goodbyes have to be conflicted, but mine certainly are.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="highlight">â&#128;&#156;In the name of Allah, I beg you to teach my child.â&#128;&#157; Fine. She left the boy and went home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then what did the magician do but push the boy into a large room, close the door, and lock him in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â&#128;&#148; â&#128;&#156;The Boy Magicianâ&#128;&#157; <a href="#4">[4]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Arizona, I was asked to learn, and do work. There were times when graduate school felt like a locked room, but there have been plenty of magicians in the shape of friends, in the shape of mentors, in the many-shaped desert.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said goodbye to knowing peace. I said goodbye to one unbroken wrist, and then the other. I said goodbye to the sensation of being cold. I almost said goodbye to my marriage [maybe it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t that close, but it was the closest it has ever been].</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â&#128;&#156;Just imagine: I asked him how he was planning to earn his bread, and he actually wanted to learn how to get the creeps.â&#128;&#157;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â&#128;&#156;If thatâ&#128;&#153;s all thatâ&#128;&#153;s wrong,â&#128;&#157; the sexton replied, â&#128;&#156;I can help him out. Send him over to my house, and Iâ&#128;&#153;ll shape him up.â&#128;&#157;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The father liked the idea, for he thought, â&#128;&#156;Maybe this will smooth his rough edges.â&#128;&#157;</span></p>
<p><span class="highlight">The sexton took the boy in and gave him the job of ringing the church bells.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â&#128;&#148; â&#128;&#156;A Fairy Tale About a Boy Who Left Home to Learn About Fearâ&#128;&#157; <a href="#5">[5]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is fear the fulcrum? Outside of fairy tales, we fear that saying goodbye makes a departure real. It means that going back becomes impossible. Inside of fairy tales, saying goodbye must ruin the genreâ&#128;&#153;s lovely happenstance of events, the chain of one thing happening, followed by another. It must introduce the idea of the protagonist someday reversing the narrative, returning to the point of goodbye. Maybe a goodbye is antithetical to abstraction. Maybe it is too logical.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="highlight">A man of Wei named Tung Men-wu did not grieve when his son died.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> â&#128;&#156;You loved your son as no other father has in the world,â&#128;&#157; said his wife. â&#128;&#156;Now he has died, but you do not grieve. Why?â&#128;&#157;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â&#128;&#156;There was a time,â&#128;&#157; replied Tung Men-wu, â&#128;&#156;when I had never had a son. I did not grieve then. Now that he is dead, it is the same as when I had no son. What have I to grieve for?â&#128;&#157;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#156;A Dead Son,â&#128;&#157; Lieh Tzu <a href="#6">[6]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have said some goodbyes in death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said goodbye to my pet rabbit, Georgie. I said goodbye to my motherâ&#128;&#153;s father while holding my grandmotherâ&#128;&#153;s hand [what a responsibility, I thought later that night, for her memory of that long-term loss to be tied to my fingers, my hand, my body, my me].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I never said goodbye to my pet cat, Zelda. I never said goodbye to my pet cat, Spike. I never said goodbye to my fatherâ&#128;&#153;s father, because he was gone before I arrived. I never said goodbye to my friend Steven, who disappeared from my life in the nine months before he committed suicide [for a semester, after getting surgery on both his knees, he convinced our Spanish teacher he </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">needed</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help carrying his backpack, affording us an extra ten minutes of lunch (we ate in a stairwell, we had a name for ourselves, but Iâ&#128;&#153;ve said goodbye to the memory of that, too)].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the man with the dead son, I am not capable of not grieving.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="highlight">One day a young man said, â&#128;&#156;This tale about everybody having to die doesnâ&#128;&#153;t set too well with me. I will go in search of the land where one never dies.â&#128;&#157;</span></p>
<p>He bid father, mother, uncles, and cousins goodbye and departed. For days and months he walked, asking everybody he met if they could direct him to the place where one never dies.</p>
<p>â&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#156;The Land Where One Never Diesâ&#128;&#157; 77-79 <a href="#7">[7]</a></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even here, we are not wealthy in detail. There are no tears, there are no words spoken, he is not afraid. The young man finds a place where no one ever dies, but he wants to see his family again. He wants to reverse the narrative. Is it only because he said goodbye? Is it because he has depth?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way home, so much time has passed that a sea has turned into a prairie, a forest has turned into desert. A mountain, flattened, carted away rock by rock. But when the young man finds that his relatives have all died long ago, the story is abstract and brutal: â&#128;&#156;That was the end of it. â&#128;&#152;I might as well go back at once,â&#128;&#153; he decided.â&#128;&#157; The return of flatness renders the goodbye into a motif, not a motivated act. It renders it meaningless.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what I find wonderful about fairy tales: they fascinate and horrify in equal measures. Goodbye or no goodbye, a fairy tale will do its finest to discomfort.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lesson here is not that we should all promise to speak our goodbyes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are, indeed, meaningless in certain ways.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lesson here is not that we should return to those places of departure, seeking comfort, or answers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The landscape has already changed beyond our recognition.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are, indeed, each venturing continually outwards, far, far to the end of our individual worlds. We are always at the envelope, the edge between. All we can do there, here, is know that there have been places behind us where we thought to say goodbye, or thought not to, or couldnâ&#128;&#153;t, or didnâ&#128;&#153;t, and that these are maybe our discomforts but they are also our definitions: we bring nothing with us but them; they are our little rings, our keepsakes, that can keep us going.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>by Bethy Wernert</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am four when she first appears to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trembling and afraid, I lie in ICU, other children dying around me. My parents sob silently. A mournful priest murmurs the last rites to someone in the room next to us, separated only by a thin curtain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My seizures have brought me here, to this place between life and death, and I feel my soul lingering in the hazy realm between worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-476" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1.jpg" alt="-1" width="1043" height="607" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1.jpg 1043w,https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-300x175.jpg 300w,https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-768x447.jpg 768w,https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-1024x596.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1043px) 100vw, 1043px"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I lie in the hospital bed, the mattress firm and cold, a shadow dances across the curtains. I feel a handâ&#128;&#148;a caressing breezeâ&#128;&#148;stroke my hair. I canâ&#128;&#153;t see her, but I <i>feel</i> her. Ancient, like trees rooted in centuries. She smells of earth after rain, and birds outside raise their choral hymn in honor of her. She whispers, her voice, maternally soothing, â&#128;&#156;Everything is okay. This is who you are, and you always will be.â&#128;&#157; She then disappears as a brush of wind trickles through the window.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The doctors come in with the verdict. â&#128;&#156;Epilepsy,â&#128;&#157; they tell me, â&#128;&#156;a seizure disorder. Idiopathicâ&#128;&#148;no one knows how itâ&#128;&#153;s caused.â&#128;&#157;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My parents leave the hospital, wondering why I was â&#128;&#156;cursed to have this disorder, thisâ&#128;&#148;this <i>disease</i>.â&#128;&#157; <i>I</i> leave the hospital feeling blessed. As tired and scared as I was, I now feel at peace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over time, I discover that Iâ&#128;&#153;m not alone, that epilepsy has long been associated with spirituality, wiring our brains to the belief in the mystical. [1] Our brains become conduits, neurons sparking our sensations to perceive the otherworldly amidst the mundane. Believing in magic, my mother raised me on myths of fairies and ghosts, shadowy nature spirits that drift between worlds. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve always believed in these spirits, but epilepsy allows me to sense them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eventually, my seizures are controlled with heavy doses of anti-epileptic medication, pentagonal, powder-white pills labeled<em> Lamictal</em>. And through the passing years, the epileptic sparks in my brain cease to light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">â&#128;&#156;You no longer have seizures,â&#128;&#157; my neurologist proclaims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I feel a loss of identity at his words, my sense of self, melting into nothingness. What am I without my seizures? Without everything Iâ&#128;&#153;ve experienced? Without everything Iâ&#128;&#153;ve seen?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, my soul remembers that realm, that place between life and death, and she still visits me, wandering through the shadows when the air is damp with rain, when the creosote breathes its gentle perfume, and when the mist clings to the crevices of the mountains. She comes when the sky is darkened with magic and storms, and she whispers, â&#128;&#156;This is who you are, and you always will be.â&#128;&#157;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Say I discovered my name on an alien terrestrial planet where, stranded, Iâ&#128;&#153;m dying in a network of caves. In the heart of them, my name is always burning. Itâ&#128;&#153;s my job to inhabit cold rock and live, somehow, but I am attracted to that molten core. Into it, I disappear completely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or, say that my name is a witch who either helps travelers or eats them. Letâ&#128;&#153;s say that I have been both travelers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or, say that my name is a feast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or, say that my name is a locked room that Iâ&#128;&#153;m not allowed to enter, that every other door in the mansion is open to me and thus of no interest. The man who owns the house says that my name is blood and death, but through the keyhole my name is a tongue of pale fire flickering in the dark.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or, say that my name is in the heart of a forest where Iâ&#128;&#153;m lost and the wind conspires against my torch. My name lives in a house Iâ&#128;&#153;ve never seen and it waits for me to come for it, to rescue it from a curse. My name is frightening, but Iâ&#128;&#153;ll know it is mine when Iâ&#128;&#153;ve pressed my lips to it, when it transforms as Iâ&#128;&#153;ve dreamed of transforming, which is to say that it becomes me and I become my name.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>At the edge of the forest, the they-child saw the one-clawed bird, its feathers glinting cerulean in the sun. The bird stopped preening itself and stared; the they-child put their fingers to their neck and slowly shook, until the mask they wore wiggled loose. Off came the long auburn hair, the blue eyes ringed with sleeplessness, the mud-red collar buttoned to the chin. Underneath it the they-child was something else, something more splendid and strange, for the first time. They lifted the girl-mask up as a sort of offering. The bird extended its one giant talon and wrapped it around the part of the mask that had hugged the they-childâ&#128;&#153;s skull. The bird started to fly, slowly at first–slow enough that the they-child could follow–and then faster, and the child found themselves lifting off the ground and gliding with new wings above the forest.</em></p>

Itâ&#128;&#153;s a very simple tale, with familiar archetypes and motifs: a young person, a bird, the woods, transformation. But itâ&#128;&#153;s a tale that Sothebyâ&#128;&#153;s–the auction house that owns Toyenâ&#128;&#153;s <em>Message from the Forest</em>, the painting my story is based on–tells differently. In their version, there is no mask, no avian helper. â&#128;&#156;An owl-like spectre bearing in its one remaining claw the severed head of a girl,â&#128;&#157; <a href="http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/european-discoveries/2014/10/message-from-the-forest-toyen.html">says Sothebyâ&#128;&#153;s of the painting</a>; they also refer to Toyen as â&#128;&#156;she.â&#128;&#157;<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> The transmasculine Surrealist has been rendered into a woman; the painting, too, has been broken into its most obvious component parts: â&#128;&#156;owl-like spectre,â&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#156;one remaining claw,â&#128;&#157; â&#128;&#156;severed head of a girl.â&#128;&#157; I want more from it, I see more in it. So I read the painting queerly–through my own experiences as a non-binary genderqueer person, through what I know about Toyen–and try to riddle out a message from the forest that makes sense to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the story I choose to write: the girl-face as mask, the one-taloned bird as helper, the they-child running freely, as themselves, into the woods at last. I think of the obvious parallels between my life and the story: my tomboyish adulation of the woods as a child, and the avian name I chose at twenty in an attempt to be proud of my small stature and jumpy mannerisms, to give myself a non-binary name that fit my non-binary gender. I think, too, about which story Toyen would have preferred–mine or Sothebyâ&#128;&#153;s, or neither. I struggle to imagine Toyen–an avowed anarchist, who hid his artistic partner, the poet JindÅ&#153;ich Heisler, of Jewish descent, from the Nazis–seeing nature, rather than humanity, as evil. Though perhaps he used the brightly colored bird as a stand-in for sinister human acts: Sothebyâ&#128;&#153;s does say, â&#128;&#156;An image of anxiety and helplessness, it gave rise to the series of twelve drawings that []he embarked on over the next two years, influenced by the Nazis occupation of Prague, entitled <em>Spectres of the Desert</em>.â&#128;&#157; Sothebyâ&#128;&#153;s has, Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure, proper art historians writing their descriptions, with proper training in historical context and technique–although I wonder what their biases make them overlook, or what they choose to ignore.</p>
<p>When I try to find something transgressive behind <em>Message from the Forest</em>–a bit of overlooked history, or a queer reading of the painting–perhaps I’ll only find my own reflection: the face of a strange and overgrown they-child standing, at the edge of the woods, girl-mask outstretched, hands trembling, wings pushing out through my shoulder blades. I’ll offer up the-gender-which-is-not-me-but-has-been-ascribed-to-me to my avian friend, who takes it and leads me deep into the woods, over rock and vine and river, to a place where all the birds are singing. Where I, too, will be a bird.</p>

<p><em>IÂ  first encountered Michael Mejia’s short story “Coyote Takes Us Home” last year, while reading Kate Bernheimer and Carmen GimÃ©nez Smith’s anthology </em><a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/306136/my-mother-she-killed-me-my-father-he-ate-me-by-edited-by-kate-bernheimer/9780143117841/">My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me</a><em>. As a story based on Mexican folktales that addresses the U.S.-Mexico border, it stands out in an anthology that–while excellent–mostly draws upon European lore. Mejia carved out time in his busy schedule (he teaches creative writing at the University of Utah, is the Editor-in-chief of </em><a href="http://ourworld.info/whrweb/">Western Humanities Review</a><em>, the co-founding editor of <a href="http://www.ninebarkpress.org/">Ninebark Press</a>, and the author of the novel </em><a href="http://www.fc2.org/authors/mejia/forget/forgetfulness.html">Forgetfulness</a><em>) to talk to me about “Coyote Takes Us Home,” the fraught landscape of the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, and the trips he took south of the border in an effort to learn about his Mexican heritage.</em></p>
<p><strong>I live near the U.S.-Mexican border–in Tucson, Arizona–and I encountered your story, “Coyote Takes Us Home,” while writing about borderland fairy tales and folklore for the <i>Fairy Tale Review</i> blog. Why did you decide to write a newfangled fairy tale about crossing the border?</strong></p>
<p>As with any good fairy tale, there are three knocks required to open this question.</p>
<p>The first reveals an answer you may already know. In my note following “Coyote Takes Us Home<i>,”</i> I mention having half-heard, some years ago, a news report about unaccompanied minors stowed in cars crossing the border, in a way we might expect with shipments of drugs. It’s fantastic, of course, and dangerous, and absurd, and real. Parents leave their children with relatives, come to the U.S., work to pay for the kids’ care, eventually putting aside enough to have them sent north, through a network of strangers, and smuggled across the border. Sometimes the parents will be forced to pay thousands of dollars more, a ransom, to have the kids delivered as much as 2000 miles away, to North Carolina or Pennsylvania, Washington or Chicago. Or the kids might get caught along the way and repatriated to a shelter on the Mexican side of the border. A phone call or a fax from their parents, a promise to send them home, to not to try again, can be enough to get them released, and that night they’ll be back in the Arizona desert.</p>
<p>The story got even more desperate in 2014, when more than 40,000 kids from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala (far more than from Mexico) were fleeing gang violence and recruitment as well as poverty. They came walking, riding buses, and riding the tops of trains across multiple borders on their way north, with no family at all in the US.Â  Aside from finding these stories terrifying and sadâ&#128;&#148;though ifâ&#128;¦whenâ&#128;¦the kids do make it across, I think we know there’s a real chance at something like a happy endingâ&#128;&#148;I wanted to consider the issues of abandoning your home place, the socio-economic pressures that would make that place unlivable, the unexpected uprooting that occurs on that morning word comes that you’re to get in the car, on the bus, and the loss of cultural knowledge this journey represents. Which brings me to the second knock.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://carmenmariamachado.com/">Carmen Maria Machado</a> writes rich, fabulist fiction that draws on fairy tales and folklore. She has some exciting publications forthcoming–including a debut short story collection, </em>Her Body & Other Parties<em> (Graywolf Press), and a story in The Ochre Issue of </em><a href="http://fairytalereview.com/">Fairy Tale Review</a><em>. For this interview, however, I decided to ask Machado about an older story– <a href="http://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/">“The Husband Stitch,”</a> published by </em>Granta<em> in October 2014, and inspired by a frightening children’s tale, urban legends, and the experience of being an awkward kid at Girl Scout Camp.</em></p>
<p><b>“The Husband Stitch,” is a variation on “The Green Ribbon,” a popular scary story (I remember it well from childhood!). How did you first encounter “The Green Ribbon”? Why did you decide to write your own version of it?Â </b></p>
<p>I first read â&#128;&#156;The Green Ribbonâ&#128;&#157; in Alvin Schwartzâ&#128;&#153;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Dark,_Dark_Room_and_Other_Scary_Stories"><i>In a Dark, Dark Room and Other Scary Stories</i></a>, a childrenâ&#128;&#153;s book in the vein of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scary_Stories_to_Tell_in_the_Dark"><i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i></a> series. (Though with significantly less terrifying illustrations.) Anyway, <i>In a Dark, Dark Room</i> had a story called â&#128;&#156;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3PIkV2anqk">The Green Ribbon</a>,â&#128;&#157; by which I was simultaneously repulsed and entranced. Of all the urban legend and folktale retellings in Schwartzâ&#128;&#153;s oeuvre, thatâ&#128;&#153;s the one that stuck with me the most.</p>
<p>Later, when I was in graduate school, I was hanging out with friends when <i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i> came up in conversation. That series pretty much scared everyone in my generation, and each person in my group had a different story from it thatâ&#128;&#153;d scared the bejeesus out of them as kids.</p>
<p>My brain kept returning to â&#128;&#156;The Green Ribbon,â&#128;&#157; and it occurred to me that there are all kinds of interesting currents about gender running beneath that storyâ&#128;&#153;s deceptively simple ice. That summer, I sat down and wrote the first draft of â&#128;&#156;<a href="http://granta.com/The-Husband-Stitch/">The Husband Stitch</a>.â&#128;&#157; At the time, it was just a straight re-telling of the protagonistâ&#128;&#153;s story from meeting her future husband to her head falling off; the metafictional elements and retellings of other urban legends came later in the editing process.</p>
