								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Growing up, you were shy. Or maybe you were short, you were fat, you had bad teeth. You had frizzy hair, you wet the bed, you spoke with a stammer. You slept with a stuffed toy ‘til you were twelve, or ‘til you were twenty, or ‘til your monthly blood ran out and you began soaking the bed with night sweats and hot flashes and Mississippi-wide rivers of regrets. You’re almost an old woman now. Love and transcendence have passed you by. Those fairy tales you were fed by Hollywood and MTV and Hans Christian Andersen as a child, and the ones you fed yourself to get by, through the loneliness of the school playground, through the long tick-tocking overthinking of the night, through the daily treacheries of life – they all lied.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-840" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed.jpg" alt="" width="735" height="651" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed.jpg 735w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed-300x266.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which fairy tale was it you always went back to, the one you believed in most? The one with the song saying someday your prince would come? Or the one where the funny-looking little duckling (you don’t like to say “ugly” – it’s a word that’s been used against you so many times) turns into a stunner of a swan? Did you think that might be you one day? Did you really? All along, you should have paid more attention to the crone, the ogre, the unredeemed outcasts, the ones haunting the margins, or worse yet, the ordinary ones, the unmagical, the unnamed and underappreciated. Because these were your destiny – not the beautiful ones, not the princess and the swan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or maybe the fairy tales didn’t lie. You just saw in them what you wanted, took what you needed. Beauty, hope, promises of happily ever after, some danger to make things interesting, some fear to cut through the dull of the everyday. You simply ignored the despair. Even though all fairy tales, and all life, is rife with it. Like that moment in <a href="http://hca.gilead.org.il/ugly_duc.html">Andersen’s tale about the duckling</a>, when the bullied little bird welcomes the beauty of spring and a bevy of swans with pure, piercing heartache:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">“I will fly to those royal birds,” he exclaimed, “and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter…”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">Then he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans. The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">“Kill me,” said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the next moment the duckling sees his reflection in the water, sees a swan looking back – his transformed self, his true tribe, his happily ever after. I wonder though, if the duckling had seen no change, no beauty, no swan staring back at him in the water, could he still have survived? Would he still have come to know happiness, belonging, self-love?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I need to know, same as every once and for-all-time misfit. Is there magic after all in despair? Can there be beauty in forsaken hope, transcendence without transformation, belonging when you’re the only one around to hear your own questions, a happy ending when the fairy tale, or life, or maybe yourself, is found so wanting?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Think back on the ones you paid too little attention to, while you were paying as little attention to the beauty in your worst and best self. The crone, the ogre, the marginal, the ordinary. The untransformed duckling. The resilient, the persisting, the interesting and astute, the ultimately self-accepting and wise. Lucky you – these were your destiny. The unbeautiful ones, who know how to make magic out of the most disappointing circumstances, to potion up an unbreakable spell of endurance out of yesterday’s cold pot of despair. Let them teach you to love whatever reflection stares back at you, to see the beauty in even a fantastically imperfect you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a statue near the border of Nogales, Arizona of a small boy. Every time my mother, brother, and I would walk by she’d turn to us and say that if we misbehaved or did not follow her instructions we would become a statue just like that small boy. My mother was always aided by folk tales or myths to scare us into thinking that if we deliberately disobeyed her, consequences would arise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mother is from Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. Molded by a culture full of folk tales and old proverbs, she passed on generations of stories to my siblings and I.  My mother shared the legends of El Cucuy, the Mexican boogeymann and El Chupacabra, a goat-like creature the size of a small bear&#8211;its spines reaching from its neck to the base of its tail&#8211;that haunts the desert. She also told me about La Llorona.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">La Llorona</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is told as a cautionary tale to children to make them behave properly. Different versions of the story are told depending on the region. Some say the story focuses on Maria, a woman so beautiful that all the men in her town attempted to woo her each time she walked by. Maria, with a sense of self absorption, believed she deserved the attention. She would flirt with the men but vowed only to marry the most handsome and wealthiest man she could find. The only problem interfering with her lifestyle? Her two sons. So she decided to drown them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other versions of the tale say Maria married a wealthy man and they were happy. She bore him two sons. After a time, the man would go away for long periods of time and when he returned, only focused on his sons. One day, he returned with another woman at his side and left again. Enraged, Maria drowned her two children in the river. Maria became deeply remorseful and wandered along the banks hoping her sons would return. It is said that when she finally died, her weeping spirit wandered the land, crying, “¡Ay, mis hijos!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-822 size-full" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault.jpg 480w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day when I was five, my three siblings and I were playing a game of freeze tag on my grandma’s patio. Our dogs chased and barked at us. The daylight was quickly vanishing and the street lamps were turning on. As the sun set, my mother called out to us and yelled it was time to return inside. We didn’t listen. She yelled out, “¡Si no regresan ya, los va a agarrar La Llorona!” which roughly translates to, “If you don’t return now, La Llorona will come get you.” My brothers stopped playing and ran inside. I didn’t understand who my mom was speaking of because I was the youngest and had not heard the tale. I stayed outside for another five minutes and when I decided to go back, I found the door was locked. My mom on the other side said it was too late and La Llorona coming. Panicking, I begged to go inside. She hesitated. I said I was sorry for not coming back when she asked. The door unlocked and I ran inside. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat on a rusty old stool as I listened to my mother explain the importance of La Llorona. A weeping women all dressed in a white dress and her face covered by a white veil. She wouldn’t rest until she found her kids. That’s when my mom uttered the word: “Unless&#8230;” I stared at her, tightening my eyebrows. “Unless she finds other children, children who misbehave, and takes them instead.” I felt my skin lose its smoothness and small bumps started forming from my forearm to my shoulder. “La Llorona will come as soon as the lights on the street start turning on. Make sure you’re inside when the street lamps glow.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-753" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2.jpg" alt="" width="910" height="614" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2.jpg 910w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2-768x518.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My mother’s kitchen cupboards are stocked with ancestral memories; crammed with what may look like ordinary jars and cans, boxes and bottles—but I know better. <i>These are her hunger ghosts,</i> I think to myself every time I open the cupboards, <i>doppelgangers of old wounds and inherited hurts.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The same goes for the freezer and fridge, the fruit bowl, even the jar for cat treats. My mother hoards food. She consistently buys too much, as if she’s still cooking for a household of eight or preparing for a food shortage or a spell of famine. She overcooks too, long used to making large casseroles that needed to stretch into a couple days’ worth of leftovers. My father and I have tried talking to her, telling her to scale back, that we cannot possibly eat everything before it spoils and it’s a sin to waste food.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But I think she really is preparing for a famine, or reckoning with the haunting of one. My mother descends from the Famine Irish, the generation that left Ireland in the mid-19th century for their lives, escaping starvation and fever, mass death, and the devastation of centuries of British colonialism. Hunger is the reason she’s here, in America, and half the reason I’m here too, along with my brothers, sisters, and all my maternal cousins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Irish folk belief there’s a type of grass called <i>an féar gortach</i>, the hungry grass. Some say it’s a different shade than the green that famously carpets Ireland, more silver in color, or patchy and withered. Others say it looks like any other grass, and you only know you’ve stepped on it too late, when a great hunger suddenly comes upon you and nothing can cure it save a bite of some bread tucked away in your pockets (if you had the forethought) or a bit of your own shoelace (if you’re really stuck). It’s said hungry grass grows wherever a corpse has been laid down or someone has died. The belief predates <i>An Gorta Mór</i> of the 1840s, the Great Hunger. But <i>an féar gortach</i> took on a new, ghastly meaning then, in an era when famine victims were found in fields and on roadsides, a ring of green around their open, lifeless mouths after a last, desperate meal of grass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Ireland’s potato crop failed and its people starved, its other crops were harvested and exported by the shipload to serve on British dinner tables and fill British bellies. At least a million Irish died during the Famine, their bodies buried in mass graves wherever their lives gave out. In a sense, all Ireland’s green countryside turned to hungry grass, a landscape of want and loss, of lasting trauma and emptied beauty. At least another million emigrated, became refugees, exiles, Irish-Americans, Irish-Canadians, Irish-Australians, hyphenated people, diasporic, hungry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Growing up, Mom spoke often of her family’s history, sang and played us Irish folk songs, explained to us the Famine, dressed us in green on St. Patrick’s Day. Maybe it seems a stretch to suggest my mother’s food compulsions have anything to do with an event in another country her ancestors left <i>fadó fadó</i>. But some events are simply too large, too traumatic not to eat into the blood, the DNA, the collective cultural memory of a people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mother’s ancestral memories transferred to all her children, but might have absorbed most deeply into me, her last-born child and the only one to go live in Ireland years later. I am the child who’s never married, never had children. Who’s struggled with her weight, eats when she’s not hungry, and bakes when she’s sad or simply bored. Who collects cats, books, and passport stamps like they’ll fill up some loss, some second-hand but deep-rooted want and need. The famished one, always looking for some patch of grass where the hunger finally makes sense.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>by Brian Oliu</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-627" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1.jpg" alt="1" width="989" height="612" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1.jpg 989w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1-300x186.jpg 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1-768x475.jpg 768w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1-825x510.jpg 825w" sizes="(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every story begins with a story that you already know: something that is entrenched in your core despite it seeming completely foreign at first—the moment when you realize that you dislike the bitter taste of almonds; the sight of your own blood as you dab at it with your thumb—the scarlet seeping into the ridges of your fingerprints before you rinse your body of itself clear in the bathroom sink.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the edge of my bed, a bookshelf filled with hardcovers—texts that I could call “mine” in a way that children claim things; all things received as a gift; the ornate pages, the gold trim that I would scratch at with my fingernails if I hadn’t already bitten them to flatness. The stories, too, were mine: girls and boys and frogs and toads rooted to my stomach, curving their way around the bumps in my spine, as if they had always been there, just beneath the surface, leaving their marks on the inside of my skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The games too, were mine, in a different way: whereas the stories of my youth were found within, as if they had been stitched into my core, the games were explosive in their moments—they burst into my world from the exterior, and it was my duty to capture those days sitting on a stained carpet in an upstairs hallway trying to make this other version of myself run fast enough that the boomerang would get lost amongst the rocks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These too, were stories that I already knew: of awakening in a land where all things are equal and the touch of a fleck of light could kill you where you stood—these stories of danger, or warning, of beware the outside, but push forward toward an unknown end and eat all of the fruit whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a time when I would have to shut the game off, but I could enter a different world through the pages at the foot of my bed, often scanning the same stories over and over before it was time to put my glasses on the nightstand and let all worlds blur. Some nights, when the room was too warm from the heat of all of the electronics, I could see the images of the parallax scrolling still engrained in the darkness, glowing a warm red, even when all of the lights were out—a constant revisiting, as if I were the vacuum tube casting images against the blackened windows.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<style>
  span.highlight {background-color: yellow;}<br /></style>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I begin with a question: Why are goodbyes so absent in fairy tales?</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had no rest or peace until she set out secretly, and went forth into the wide world to trace out her brothers and set them free, let it cost what it might. </span><span class="highlight">She took nothing with her but a little ring belonging to her parents as a keepsake</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a loaf of bread against hunger, a little pitcher of water against thirst, and a little chair as a provision against weariness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now she went continually onwards, far, far to the very end of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— “The Seven Ravens” <a href="#1">[1]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every story, even each of our own, involves a departure from our homes, and our parents. How this happens is different for everyone, but the ending is the same.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said goodbye to Madison, the place I was born, and to my favorite little woods in the city. I said goodbye to my mother, who cried as I packed inside the car with my wife and my dog and my cat [she cries every time I leave her, or she leaves me]. I said goodbye to my father [he always told me that if I didn’t leave the place I was raised I would always regret it, and he was right].</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when his youngest daughter came to sit next to him and be questioned, she said, “These and all other blessings are from Allah.” Angered, her father said, “Since you place so little value on what I can do for you, go and discover how many are the blessings of Allah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl tied a few clothes into a kerchief and, trusting herself to God’s protection, stepped out of her father’s house. </span><span class="highlight">She had no idea where to turn, so she walked in the direction that her face was pointing until she came to some ramshackle sheds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— “The Girl Who Spoke Jasmines and Lilies” <a href="#2">[2]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the girl, we had a destination: Tucson, a 1,700-mile drive, fairy-tale in its oddities: a Kansas hail storm, a hundred eager dust devils whipping the New Mexico border.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fairy tale must leave out the goodbye as technique, as purposeful disconnect. It renders the world a little less real. Those who love fairy tales understand the idea of flatness: characters are unnamed, and receiving only an emotional silhouetting. Our dear Kate Bernheimer says fairy-tale characters “are not in psychological conflict.”<a href="#3">[3]</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I don’t think all goodbyes have to be conflicted, but mine certainly are.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="highlight">“In the name of Allah, I beg you to teach my child.” Fine. She left the boy and went home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then what did the magician do but push the boy into a large room, close the door, and lock him in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— “The Boy Magician” <a href="#4">[4]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Arizona, I was asked to learn, and do work. There were times when graduate school felt like a locked room, but there have been plenty of magicians in the shape of friends, in the shape of mentors, in the many-shaped desert.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said goodbye to knowing peace. I said goodbye to one unbroken wrist, and then the other. I said goodbye to the sensation of being cold. I almost said goodbye to my marriage [maybe it wasn’t that close, but it was the closest it has ever been].</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just imagine: I asked him how he was planning to earn his bread, and he actually wanted to learn how to get the creeps.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If that’s all that’s wrong,” the sexton replied, “I can help him out. Send him over to my house, and I’ll shape him up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The father liked the idea, for he thought, “Maybe this will smooth his rough edges.”</span></p>
<p><span class="highlight">The sexton took the boy in and gave him the job of ringing the church bells.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— “A Fairy Tale About a Boy Who Left Home to Learn About Fear” <a href="#5">[5]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is fear the fulcrum? Outside of fairy tales, we fear that saying goodbye makes a departure real. It means that going back becomes impossible. Inside of fairy tales, saying goodbye must ruin the genre’s lovely happenstance of events, the chain of one thing happening, followed by another. It must introduce the idea of the protagonist someday reversing the narrative, returning to the point of goodbye. Maybe a goodbye is antithetical to abstraction. Maybe it is too logical.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="highlight">A man of Wei named Tung Men-wu did not grieve when his son died.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “You loved your son as no other father has in the world,” said his wife. “Now he has died, but you do not grieve. Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was a time,” replied Tung Men-wu, “when I had never had a son. I did not grieve then. Now that he is dead, it is the same as when I had no son. What have I to grieve for?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—“A Dead Son,” Lieh Tzu <a href="#6">[6]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have said some goodbyes in death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said goodbye to my pet rabbit, Georgie. I said goodbye to my mother’s father while holding my grandmother’s hand [what a responsibility, I thought later that night, for her memory of that long-term loss to be tied to my fingers, my hand, my body, my me].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I never said goodbye to my pet cat, Zelda. I never said goodbye to my pet cat, Spike. I never said goodbye to my father’s father, because he was gone before I arrived. I never said goodbye to my friend Steven, who disappeared from my life in the nine months before he committed suicide [for a semester, after getting surgery on both his knees, he convinced our Spanish teacher he </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">needed</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help carrying his backpack, affording us an extra ten minutes of lunch (we ate in a stairwell, we had a name for ourselves, but I’ve said goodbye to the memory of that, too)].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the man with the dead son, I am not capable of not grieving.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="highlight">One day a young man said, “This tale about everybody having to die doesn’t set too well with me. I will go in search of the land where one never dies.”</span></p>
<p>He bid father, mother, uncles, and cousins goodbye and departed. For days and months he walked, asking everybody he met if they could direct him to the place where one never dies.</p>
<p>—“The Land Where One Never Dies” 77-79 <a href="#7">[7]</a></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even here, we are not wealthy in detail. There are no tears, there are no words spoken, he is not afraid. The young man finds a place where no one ever dies, but he wants to see his family again. He wants to reverse the narrative. Is it only because he said goodbye? Is it because he has depth?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way home, so much time has passed that a sea has turned into a prairie, a forest has turned into desert. A mountain, flattened, carted away rock by rock. But when the young man finds that his relatives have all died long ago, the story is abstract and brutal: “That was the end of it. ‘I might as well go back at once,’ he decided.” The return of flatness renders the goodbye into a motif, not a motivated act. It renders it meaningless.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what I find wonderful about fairy tales: they fascinate and horrify in equal measures. Goodbye or no goodbye, a fairy tale will do its finest to discomfort.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lesson here is not that we should all promise to speak our goodbyes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are, indeed, meaningless in certain ways.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lesson here is not that we should return to those places of departure, seeking comfort, or answers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The landscape has already changed beyond our recognition.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are, indeed, each venturing continually outwards, far, far to the end of our individual worlds. We are always at the envelope, the edge between. All we can do there, here, is know that there have been places behind us where we thought to say goodbye, or thought not to, or couldn’t, or didn’t, and that these are maybe our discomforts but they are also our definitions: we bring nothing with us but them; they are our little rings, our keepsakes, that can keep us going.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>by Bethy Wernert</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am four when she first appears to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trembling and afraid, I lie in ICU, other children dying around me. My parents sob silently. A mournful priest murmurs the last rites to someone in the room next to us, separated only by a thin curtain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My seizures have brought me here, to this place between life and death, and I feel my soul lingering in the hazy realm between worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-476" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1.jpg" alt="-1" width="1043" height="607" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1.jpg 1043w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-300x175.jpg 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-768x447.jpg 768w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-1024x596.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1043px) 100vw, 1043px" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I lie in the hospital bed, the mattress firm and cold, a shadow dances across the curtains. I feel a hand—a caressing breeze—stroke my hair. I can’t see her, but I <i>feel</i> her. Ancient, like trees rooted in centuries. She smells of earth after rain, and birds outside raise their choral hymn in honor of her. She whispers, her voice, maternally soothing, “Everything is okay. This is who you are, and you always will be.” She then disappears as a brush of wind trickles through the window.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The doctors come in with the verdict. “Epilepsy,” they tell me, “a seizure disorder. Idiopathic—no one knows how it’s caused.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My parents leave the hospital, wondering why I was “cursed to have this disorder, this—this <i>disease</i>.” <i>I</i> leave the hospital feeling blessed. As tired and scared as I was, I now feel at peace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over time, I discover that I’m not alone, that epilepsy has long been associated with spirituality, wiring our brains to the belief in the mystical. [1] Our brains become conduits, neurons sparking our sensations to perceive the otherworldly amidst the mundane. Believing in magic, my mother raised me on myths of fairies and ghosts, shadowy nature spirits that drift between worlds. I’ve always believed in these spirits, but epilepsy allows me to sense them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eventually, my seizures are controlled with heavy doses of anti-epileptic medication, pentagonal, powder-white pills labeled<em> Lamictal</em>. And through the passing years, the epileptic sparks in my brain cease to light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“You no longer have seizures,” my neurologist proclaims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I feel a loss of identity at his words, my sense of self, melting into nothingness. What am I without my seizures? Without everything I’ve experienced? Without everything I’ve seen?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, my soul remembers that realm, that place between life and death, and she still visits me, wandering through the shadows when the air is damp with rain, when the creosote breathes its gentle perfume, and when the mist clings to the crevices of the mountains. She comes when the sky is darkened with magic and storms, and she whispers, “This is who you are, and you always will be.”</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">“The flame on its tail shows the strength of its life force. If it is weak, the flame also burns weakly.” – Pokémon Gold</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Say I discovered my name on an alien terrestrial planet where, stranded, I’m dying in a network of caves. In the heart of them, my name is always burning. It’s my job to inhabit cold rock and live, somehow, but I am attracted to that molten core. Into it, I disappear completely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or, say that my name is a witch who either helps travelers or eats them. Let’s say that I have been both travelers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or, say that my name is a feast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or, say that my name is a locked room that I’m not allowed to enter, that every other door in the mansion is open to me and thus of no interest. The man who owns the house says that my name is blood and death, but through the keyhole my name is a tongue of pale fire flickering in the dark.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or, say that my name is in the heart of a forest where I’m lost and the wind conspires against my torch. My name lives in a house I’ve never seen and it waits for me to come for it, to rescue it from a curse. My name is frightening, but I’ll know it is mine when I’ve pressed my lips to it, when it transforms as I’ve dreamed of transforming, which is to say that it becomes me and I become my name.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>At the edge of the forest, the they-child saw the one-clawed bird, its feathers glinting cerulean in the sun. The bird stopped preening itself and stared; the they-child put their fingers to their neck and slowly shook, until the mask they wore wiggled loose. Off came the long auburn hair, the blue eyes ringed with sleeplessness, the mud-red collar buttoned to the chin. Underneath it the they-child was something else, something more splendid and strange, for the first time. They lifted the girl-mask up as a sort of offering. The bird extended its one giant talon and wrapped it around the part of the mask that had hugged the they-child’s skull. The bird started to fly, slowly at first&#8211;slow enough that the they-child could follow&#8211;and then faster, and the child found themselves lifting off the ground and gliding with new wings above the forest.</em></p>

It’s a very simple tale, with familiar archetypes and motifs: a young person, a bird, the woods, transformation. But it’s a tale that Sotheby’s&#8211;the auction house that owns Toyen’s <em>Message from the Forest</em>, the painting my story is based on&#8211;tells differently. In their version, there is no mask, no avian helper. “An owl-like spectre bearing in its one remaining claw the severed head of a girl,” <a href="http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/european-discoveries/2014/10/message-from-the-forest-toyen.html">says Sotheby’s of the painting</a>; they also refer to Toyen as “she.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> The transmasculine Surrealist has been rendered into a woman; the painting, too, has been broken into its most obvious component parts: “owl-like spectre,” “one remaining claw,” “severed head of a girl.” I want more from it, I see more in it. So I read the painting queerly&#8211;through my own experiences as a non-binary genderqueer person, through what I know about Toyen&#8211;and try to riddle out a message from the forest that makes sense to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the story I choose to write: the girl-face as mask, the one-taloned bird as helper, the they-child running freely, as themselves, into the woods at last. I think of the obvious parallels between my life and the story: my tomboyish adulation of the woods as a child, and the avian name I chose at twenty in an attempt to be proud of my small stature and jumpy mannerisms, to give myself a non-binary name that fit my non-binary gender. I think, too, about which story Toyen would have preferred&#8211;mine or Sotheby’s, or neither. I struggle to imagine Toyen&#8211;an avowed anarchist, who hid his artistic partner, the poet Jindřich Heisler, of Jewish descent, from the Nazis&#8211;seeing nature, rather than humanity, as evil. Though perhaps he used the brightly colored bird as a stand-in for sinister human acts: Sotheby’s does say, “An image of anxiety and helplessness, it gave rise to the series of twelve drawings that []he embarked on over the next two years, influenced by the Nazis occupation of Prague, entitled <em>Spectres of the Desert</em>.” Sotheby’s has, I’m sure, proper art historians writing their descriptions, with proper training in historical context and technique&#8211;although I wonder what their biases make them overlook, or what they choose to ignore.</p>
<p>When I try to find something transgressive behind <em>Message from the Forest</em>&#8211;a bit of overlooked history, or a queer reading of the painting&#8211;perhaps I&#8217;ll only find my own reflection: the face of a strange and overgrown they-child standing, at the edge of the woods, girl-mask outstretched, hands trembling, wings pushing out through my shoulder blades. I&#8217;ll offer up the-gender-which-is-not-me-but-has-been-ascribed-to-me to my avian friend, who takes it and leads me deep into the woods, over rock and vine and river, to a place where all the birds are singing. Where I, too, will be a bird.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1"> </a> [1] This is common across the internet and in academic articles I’ve found on Toyen (Czech, 1902-1980). It is well-known that Toyen used the masculine case for himself and lived as a man yet art history seems to insist on presenting him as a cisgendered woman.</p>

<p><em>I  first encountered Michael Mejia&#8217;s short story &#8220;Coyote Takes Us Home&#8221; last year, while reading Kate Bernheimer and Carmen Giménez Smith&#8217;s anthology </em><a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/306136/my-mother-she-killed-me-my-father-he-ate-me-by-edited-by-kate-bernheimer/9780143117841/">My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me</a><em>. As a story based on Mexican folktales that addresses the U.S.-Mexico border, it stands out in an anthology that&#8211;while excellent&#8211;mostly draws upon European lore. Mejia carved out time in his busy schedule (he teaches creative writing at the University of Utah, is the Editor-in-chief of </em><a href="http://ourworld.info/whrweb/">Western Humanities Review</a><em>, the co-founding editor of <a href="http://www.ninebarkpress.org/">Ninebark Press</a>, and the author of the novel </em><a href="http://www.fc2.org/authors/mejia/forget/forgetfulness.html">Forgetfulness</a><em>) to talk to me about &#8220;Coyote Takes Us Home,&#8221; the fraught landscape of the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, and the trips he took south of the border in an effort to learn about his Mexican heritage.</em></p>
<p><strong>I live near the U.S.-Mexican border&#8211;in Tucson, Arizona&#8211;and I encountered your story, &#8220;Coyote Takes Us Home,&#8221; while writing about borderland fairy tales and folklore for the <i>Fairy Tale Review</i> blog. Why did you decide to write a newfangled fairy tale about crossing the border?</strong></p>
<p>As with any good fairy tale, there are three knocks required to open this question.</p>
<p>The first reveals an answer you may already know. In my note following &#8220;Coyote Takes Us Home<i>,&#8221;</i> I mention having half-heard, some years ago, a news report about unaccompanied minors stowed in cars crossing the border, in a way we might expect with shipments of drugs. It&#8217;s fantastic, of course, and dangerous, and absurd, and real. Parents leave their children with relatives, come to the U.S., work to pay for the kids&#8217; care, eventually putting aside enough to have them sent north, through a network of strangers, and smuggled across the border. Sometimes the parents will be forced to pay thousands of dollars more, a ransom, to have the kids delivered as much as 2000 miles away, to North Carolina or Pennsylvania, Washington or Chicago. Or the kids might get caught along the way and repatriated to a shelter on the Mexican side of the border. A phone call or a fax from their parents, a promise to send them home, to not to try again, can be enough to get them released, and that night they&#8217;ll be back in the Arizona desert.</p>
<p>The story got even more desperate in 2014, when more than 40,000 kids from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala (far more than from Mexico) were fleeing gang violence and recruitment as well as poverty. They came walking, riding buses, and riding the tops of trains across multiple borders on their way north, with no family at all in the US.  Aside from finding these stories terrifying and sad—though if…when…the kids do make it across, I think we know there&#8217;s a real chance at something like a happy ending—I wanted to consider the issues of abandoning your home place, the socio-economic pressures that would make that place unlivable, the unexpected uprooting that occurs on that morning word comes that you&#8217;re to get in the car, on the bus, and the loss of cultural knowledge this journey represents. Which brings me to the second knock.</p>
<p><span id="more-329"></span></p>
<p>This one reveals that &#8220;Coyote&#8221; emerged from another project, a book of nonfiction I was researching at the time, about my family&#8217;s roots in Mexico. I&#8217;d been traveling there—to Jalisco first, to Guadalajara and Tequila—where my grandmother was born, where my great-grandfather was a tequila taster around the turn of the twentieth century—but also to Guanajuato, San Miguel de Allende, Querétaro, and Mexico City, about once a year from 2006 to 2009. I&#8217;d developed a desire, maybe a need, to better understand my Mexicanness, to find a way to value it, to embrace it as I hadn&#8217;t so much when I was younger. On the first trip, I knew no Spanish. That was deliberate. I needed to work for my reward. (One might also read this as self-punishment. I was raised Catholic, and oh, how I admire the bloodied and broken bodies of indigenous-made Christs.) I started teaching myself after the first trip and was eventually able to sustain some basic conversation.</p>
<p>That spring before I first visited Tequila, I&#8217;d planned to spend some time interviewing my father about his childhood in Texas, where he was born, and his own sense of his heritage, and my grandmother about her youth and her emigration in 1924. I&#8217;d recorded her telling me that story, and the story of my father&#8217;s father—who he never knew—about ten years earlier, but by 2006 I felt greater urgency to fill out those briefly-sketched tales and to explore my reasons for wanting to better identify the Mexican in me.</p>
<p>Then my father and my grandmother both died, within about a month of each other, before I&#8217;d had a chance to ask for more. All I had to go on was the tape, with all its questions and gaps. Between my trips to Mexico, I sat down with cousins, aunts, and my uncle for interviews. The project, obviously, was very openly personal, unusual for me, and I kind of stalled out, finally, a little overwhelmed by my research, and uncomfortable with the various starts I&#8217;d made to piece it together into a book. I could construct a narrative of our history, but I wasn&#8217;t sure yet how I wanted to represent it or talk about it.</p>
<p>Kate Bernheimer and Carmen Giménez-Smith&#8217;s invitation to contribute an updated fairy tale to <i>My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me</i> showed up in my inbox at that exact moment, a magic key. I&#8217;d written an essay on the tale of Bluebeard some years earlier for Kate&#8217;s <i>Brothers &amp; Beasts</i>, an anthology of men writing about fairy tales. I think my first impulse was to turn again to that story, but then, given what I&#8217;d been immersed in, I thought this was an opportunity to explore my Mexico through other means, through fiction, whose distance provided a fresh and less sentimental connection. Much of the imagery in &#8220;Coyote&#8221;—its street markets, its festivals, its bricolage of detritus and souvenirs and smells and flavors—was imported from my research trips to Mexico. The narrative&#8217;s concerns with cultural loss, figured in ruins and stories, in abandoned characters out of context, may be my attempt to imagine my grandmother&#8217;s experience as much as those of contemporary children.</p>
<p>So, the third knock.</p>
<p>Crossing the border, any border, with the aim of immigration, is a kind of fairy tale, a classic journey of danger and education. It requires guides, more or less honest, or you make the journey at your own peril. You go to the border to be reborn, to come out new on the other side, more free, more yourself, maybe, which means someone else.</p>
<p>This fairy tale—I mean this now not as something ephemeral, but, better, a dream that can become reality—was what my grandmother was after, what her cousin had achieved for himself in Texas and then California, before returning to Mexico to rescue her from a sugar plantation near Ameca, Jalisco, as he&#8217;d promised his mother before she died. His white horse was waiting on the edge of town for them, the cousin, my grandmother, her oldest daughter, her unborn child. That&#8217;s how my youngest aunt heard it from my grandmother before drifting to sleep in the moonlight. By then, the ugly details of my grandmother&#8217;s early marriage at 14, the physical and emotional abuse she suffered from her husband—an alcoholic who was later killed in a knife fight, who left her to beg for food while he ate well-enough with his parents—the burden of her alcoholic father, had been redacted. They left the husband behind, my grandmother told me. They lied about how they were related to avoid uncomfortable questions. My grandmother was her cousin&#8217;s sister. Her daughter was their younger sister. Do they live happily ever after? That&#8217;s a story for another time.</p>
<p><strong>In the note that follows your story, you mention that the folk tales you wove into &#8220;Coyote Takes Us Home&#8221; come from Jalisco, Mexico, where your grandmother was born. How did you first encounter these stories? Which of these traditional tales is your favorite?</strong></p>
<p>When I started &#8220;Coyote,&#8221; I knew nothing about Mexican fairy tales. (Why, oh why, do I always make things as hard as possible?) I knew something about Aztec myth, of course, but I understood that this wasn&#8217;t really the point of the anthology, and also that the Aztecs were just one group that had populated what became Mexico, particularly the central region, and that they weren&#8217;t really prominent in the west, where Jalisco is located. They weren&#8217;t my people.</p>
<p>Also, notice that I don&#8217;t use the term abuela when I refer to my grandmother. That&#8217;s not who she was to me. I&#8217;m trying to think of a time I actually heard anyone refer to her that way. She didn&#8217;t share stories of the old country with me or with her other grandchildren, so far as I know, the way we see in many memoirs of loving abuelitas and assimilation. Some say she loved Mexico. Some say she hated it. She did go back several times after a period of separation, but she was also happy to return home to America.</p>
<p>So I got on a university library website and did a search for Mexican fairy tales. Among other things, I turned up a 1943 volume published by The American Folklore Society called <i>Tales from Jalisco, Mexico</i>, edited by Howard True Wheeler. It&#8217;s a kind of Lomaxian project (Alan Lomax and his father John were both members of the society), in which Wheeler wandered the Jaliscan countryside, soliciting tales from the locals. The names of the storytellers, the Mexicans, were expunged. Wheeler only includes the name of the town nearest to where he heard the tale. &#8220;Few informants,&#8221; he writes in his brief introduction, &#8220;were able to read and write and, even from those, a very small percentage of purely literary tales was obtained. These literary tales I eliminated.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure why it was necessary to suppress the local literary style from the collection, but already this text seemed to speak directly to my interest in distance and cultural erasure. These were not obstacles for me to overcome. They were, they remain, the elements of my condition. Also, the tales are all printed in Spanish, rendered, according to Wheeler, as closely as possible in the &#8220;fine type of Castilian&#8221; spoken in Jalisco at the time. I couldn&#8217;t read them. I relied, instead, on the English précis that headed each tale, and, when necessary, did my best to decipher the Spanish. These tales, like the detritus mentioned before, are scattered throughout &#8220;Coyote,&#8221; each section mashing up bits and pieces of the central images, characters, and events from several tales. Throw a stone, you&#8217;ll hit one.</p>
<p>As I say in my note, I was interested in the way the stories seemed to illustrate the varied strata of Mexican history, from pre-Conquest, to the colonial period, to post-Independence. The first period is represented, in my mind, by the animal stories, featuring coyotes, alligators, rats, ants, serpents, chickens, bulls. These last, though—the chickens, the bulls, and other farm animals—indicate that the Spanish have already arrived. The second group consists of translations or variants of European classics, retaining their kings, princesses, and castles. &#8220;Blanca Nieve,&#8221; for example. I remember my father teasing me when I was a kid with the Spanish name for Snow White, pretending he&#8217;d lost his ability to speak English.</p>
<p>The last are my favorites, in which clever Indians and mestizo campesinos often get the upper hand over an aged, often drunk, and bumbling priestly class. I love their quality of derision and their vulgarity, powerful forms of resistance. These are characters I recognize from my own family as well as from some of my favorite encounters on my research trips. There&#8217;s a fated darkness to these stories, and a violent struggle against oppressive institutions. For the moment, the downtrodden gain the upper hand, and it&#8217;s hilarious. When the feather tossed in the air lands on the priest, it&#8217;s him who&#8217;s condemned to hell, not some individual in the congregation of campesinos he&#8217;s trying to frighten with the absurd exercise, the congregation that flees, that frees itself from the confines of the church, believing the devil is already on his way. Instantly, all the church&#8217;s lessons are turned on their head, revealing the persistence of an indigenous will that cannot be eradicated.</p>
<p>If I have one favorite among these tales, it&#8217;s probably &#8220;El Porquito,&#8221; in which a family has nothing of value but a pig they&#8217;re feeding until it shits fat, &#8220;cague cebito.&#8221; The hungry daughter sticks a candle in the pig&#8217;s ass to give the impression that the time has arrived, fooling her mother, and this leads not just to the pig&#8217;s premature slaughter, but to a series of events—involving the Virgin Mary, Saint Peter, talking roosters and turkeys, and a donkey&#8217;s ass appearing on someone&#8217;s forehead—that reveal traitorous streaks in both the mother and an orphan girl living with the family. The father, having missed out on the fresh carnitas while he was away, is served fried portions of the mother&#8217;s buttocks as a ruse. I love the commingling of the sacred and the profane here, the tale&#8217;s unpredictable turns, its bizarrerie, its low humor, the asses and shit that are worth gold in this context. It&#8217;s not a particularly pleasant story, I suppose, but I think it describes a kind of reality for the now-unknown teller about the nature of his poverty, and that of his predecessors, that needs hearing, a reality my characters in &#8220;Coyote&#8221; are quite familiar with themselves before they hit the road.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Coyote Takes Us Home&#8221; dwells in the tension between the fantastic and the violent. At one point in the story, the moon is making the child travelers posole and tortillas. &#8220;&#8216;But where is Yolanda? Where is Areli? What happened to Pancho and Enrique?'&#8221; the moon asks, to which the narrator thinks, &#8220;The truth is not so pretty.&#8221; Throughout the journey, kids riding in the Nova are turned to paper and stolen by birds, among other, more graphic fates. Why did you choose to weave fairy tales together with the violence that too often accompanies crossing the border? Do you think those fairy tales encourage the reader to think about that violence differently? How?</strong></p>
<p>Great question. I think, first, the violence in &#8220;Coyote&#8221; is representative of the violence we often encounter in fairy tales—though maybe it&#8217;s more widespread and constant here—and particularly in the tales of Jalisco on which I&#8217;ve drawn. But I&#8217;ve also worked to create a somewhat realistic backdrop against which this violence occurs, which I hope highlights the general lack of safety one accepts when traveling the routes Coyote&#8217;s Nova does. Disappearance and death are always possible. Hopefully the flatness of the collective narrator&#8217;s response to the gradual dissipation of the group communicates a kind of resignation, echoing a fatalism I sensed in the stories in Wheeler&#8217;s <i>Tales</i>, and that of ordinary Mexicans I met on my trips to Tequila, who reluctantly accept indefensible inequality and the corruption of their local institutions, but still manage to maintain substantial dignity as they attempt to work within the system. It&#8217;s not to say the kids Coyote&#8217;s transporting are resigned to die, more that their lives have trained them to manage their expectations and to value their continued existence as less fortunate others fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>Also I think there are at least two kinds of violence at the border. There&#8217;s the violence of the crossing, which can mean the self-abuse of a long walk across a killing desert—a funneling into the furnace created by stricter, post-9/11 U.S. border policies and more fences, more surveillance devices, more militarized American manpower—as well as the abusive treatment guides subject their charges to, abandoning them to the sun or cramming them to suffocating overcapacity into a car&#8217;s trunk or a box truck. And then there&#8217;s the related violence of the drug war, which got significantly worse during the time I was working on this story.</p>
<p>Set between or against these, of course, are the various American agencies authorized for border security—DHS, CBP, ICE, BEST, state and local police forces, et al.—and unauthorized vigilante groups who&#8217;ve charged themselves with filling perceived gaps and often have a violent and racist rhetoric of condemnation of immigrants and their home nations. It should also be acknowledged, however, that while there&#8217;ve been notable incidents of violence perpetrated by, and claims of abuse against, American law enforcement at the border, Border Patrol agents are most often the people who rescue immigrants from dying in the desert.</p>
<p>In 2009, while on a research trip to El Paso, I was warned repeatedly not to go to Juarez, just one bridge away from downtown, not a sister city so much as a conjoined twin, as is the case with most cities and towns on the border. The morning I landed, several bodies had been discovered in a shallow grave in the desert on the Mexican side. The grave was a kindness. That same year, a well-known hit man nicknamed &#8220;el Pozolero,&#8221; The Pozole Maker, was captured in Tijuana. He got this name for his trademark practice of dissolving murder victims in barrels of acid. Again, those disappearances were both expedient and generous compared to the humiliating public displays of heads and hanging corpses that seem to have become the norm more recently. In 2011, two days before the city&#8217;s renowned International Book Fair, three van-loads of bodies were left in a traffic circle near a central monument in Guadalajara, a message sent by a local gang allied with Sinaloa&#8217;s El Chapo to their rivals, the Zetas. Though conflict was on the rise there, Guadalajara had, until then, remained relatively immune to the cartel violence rampaging elsewhere around the country.</p>
<p>This brings me back to vulgarity and its significance in Mexican life. Certainly these examples and others are representative of a horrific extreme, but I think they arise from a shared language of abjection, black humor, and vulgarity—forms of resistance, as I&#8217;ve said, terms I&#8217;m using with some admiration—and perhaps also the surreal, that one finds in many venues and media in Mexico. Advertisements and packaging, in their way, are violent. Popular culture, television, and popular music are violent, those attacking brass sections accompanied by whirling clarinets, the exploding rockets a boy lights and releases from his bare, gunpowder-blackened hand. Violence is, I think, very much a part of Mexico, though I don&#8217;t really mean that to be a criticism. And I also don&#8217;t mean to overemphasize the idea because surely I&#8217;ve encountered plenty of quiet generosity and kindness during my visits as well, much more than violence, and my Coyote is, after all, a fairly beneficent guide, trying to provide some education to his kids as they prepare to leave home forever (the &#8220;home&#8221; in the story&#8217;s title is intentionally ambiguous), to give them something to remember about an important, maybe the most important, part of themselves. Maybe I&#8217;m inclined to think of violence in Mexico as an aspect of boldness and vitality instead, a self-consuming explosion of life, an embrace of the tenuous nature of any seeming stability. Municipal presidents and candidates for governor are assassinated. The wealthy are kidnapped and held for ransom. Maybe I&#8217;m not sure yet what I think about violence in Mexico, border-related or otherwise, only that I know it exists, abundantly, that one feels its nearness, the nearness of death, and that this is one way Mexico, my Mexico, reminds us to live. Everything is always at risk, so why not keep playing with the devil, who tends to be more of a jester or a sad sack than a Prince of Darkness, less so than the drug kingpin who you hope to never meet? Any dire situation might be turned back by a derisive laugh and a curse. Maybe it&#8217;s the last laugh, maybe not.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://carmenmariamachado.com/">Carmen Maria Machado</a> writes rich, fabulist fiction that draws on fairy tales and folklore. She has some exciting publications forthcoming&#8211;including a debut short story collection, </em>Her Body &amp; Other Parties<em> (Graywolf Press), and a story in The Ochre Issue of </em><a href="http://fairytalereview.com/">Fairy Tale Review</a><em>. For this interview, however, I decided to ask Machado about an older story&#8211; <a href="http://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/">&#8220;The Husband Stitch,&#8221;</a> published by </em>Granta<em> in October 2014, and inspired by a frightening children&#8217;s tale, urban legends, and the experience of being an awkward kid at Girl Scout Camp.</em></p>
<p><b>&#8220;The Husband Stitch,&#8221; is a variation on &#8220;The Green Ribbon,&#8221; a popular scary story (I remember it well from childhood!). How did you first encounter &#8220;The Green Ribbon&#8221;? Why did you decide to write your own version of it? </b></p>
<p>I first read “The Green Ribbon” in Alvin Schwartz’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Dark,_Dark_Room_and_Other_Scary_Stories"><i>In a Dark, Dark Room and Other Scary Stories</i></a>, a children’s book in the vein of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scary_Stories_to_Tell_in_the_Dark"><i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i></a> series. (Though with significantly less terrifying illustrations.) Anyway, <i>In a Dark, Dark Room</i> had a story called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3PIkV2anqk">The Green Ribbon</a>,” by which I was simultaneously repulsed and entranced. Of all the urban legend and folktale retellings in Schwartz’s oeuvre, that’s the one that stuck with me the most.</p>
<p>Later, when I was in graduate school, I was hanging out with friends when <i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i> came up in conversation. That series pretty much scared everyone in my generation, and each person in my group had a different story from it that’d scared the bejeesus out of them as kids.</p>
<p>My brain kept returning to “The Green Ribbon,” and it occurred to me that there are all kinds of interesting currents about gender running beneath that story’s deceptively simple ice. That summer, I sat down and wrote the first draft of “<a href="http://granta.com/The-Husband-Stitch/">The Husband Stitch</a>.” At the time, it was just a straight re-telling of the protagonist’s story from meeting her future husband to her head falling off; the metafictional elements and retellings of other urban legends came later in the editing process.</p>
<p><span id="more-305"></span></p>
<p><b>Themes of transgressive female desire and secret female knowledge are central to &#8220;The Husband Stitch.&#8221; The story is based on a scary folk tale, and weaves in references to other frightening stories and fairy tales. What do you think it is about fairy tales, folk tales and scary stories that make them such great devices for exploring these themes? </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kate Bernheimer has a wonderful essay, “<a href="http://www.katebernheimer.com/images/Fairy%20Tale%20is%20Form.pdf">Fairy Tale is Form, Form is Fairy Tale</a>,” in which she praises the “artistic dexterity” of the fairy tale and discusses a critical part of the form: flatness. She writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 90px;">This absence of depth, this flatness, violates a technical rule writers are often taught in beginning writing classes: that a character’s psychological depth is crucial to a story. In a fairy tale, however, this flatness functions beautifully; it allows depth of response in the reader.</p>
<p>This syncs up very closely with my own experience: that an ostensibly flat fairy tale with minimalist, abstract prose permits a range of deep emotions in a capable reader. Plus, a writer adapting a fairy tale has infinite tools at her disposal; she can tweak some or all of the form’s elements, and perform any other number of techniques (modernization, reversal of point-of-view, blending with another story, etc.) into near-infinite variations. The fairy tale is simply an excellent foundation for its own interrogation.</p>
<p>But in addition to the flexibility of the flatness—and perhaps more importantly—there’s also the “fairy tale as mirror” factor. No one will deny that many fairy tales have their own demented, regressive logic and morality, particularly when it comes to issues of gender. Giambattista Basile&#8217;s “The Old Woman Who Was Skinned,” for example—the origin of my <i>Fairy Tale Review</i> story “<a href="http://fairytalereview.com/the-ochre-issue/">The Old Women Who Were Skinned</a>”—is about an old woman permitting herself to be literally skinned so that she might be beautiful as her fairy-transformed sister, with a “lesson” at the end about vanity. “<a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/frog.html#grimm1">The Frog King</a>” is deeply and uncritically rape-y. The Charles Perrault version of “<a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0312.html#perrault">Bluebeard</a>,” a story about abuse and femicide, has <i>two</i> terrible “morals”—</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><b>Moral:</b> Curiosity, in spite of its appeal, often leads to deep regret. To the displeasure of many a maiden, its enjoyment is short lived. Once satisfied, it ceases to exist, and always costs dearly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><b>Another moral:</b> Apply logic to this grim story, and you will ascertain that it took place many years ago. No husband of our age would be so terrible as to demand the impossible of his wife, nor would he be such a jealous malcontent. For, whatever the color of her husband&#8217;s beard, the wife of today will let him know who the master is.</p>
<p>—neither of which properly gets at the heart of the story’s true horror. In fact, they almost appear to deliberately, laughably miss the story’s monstrosity.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that these morals serve as powerful mirrors for women’s actual relationships with the world: how we are steeped in a culture of rape and violence and death; how, if we resist, we are punished; how, even if we punish ourselves, we are mocked and blamed. And these mirrors are not (just) historical, not vague and old-timey and how it used to be. They are mirrors of here, now, today.</p>
<p>The fairy tale usually plays this element straight, of course, but that makes them virtual playgrounds for feminist writers; all we have to do is pick a story up and turn it askance.</p>
<p><b>The motif of the green ribbon, coupled with the themes of transgressive desire and secret knowledge, reminded me of Angela Carter&#8217;s short story &#8220;The Bloody Chamber&#8221; (a variation on Bluebeard in which the protagonist is gifted a red ribbon by her betrothed—a ribbon that prefigures the way he wants to kill her). Are you familiar with this story? Has Angela Carter inspired your work? What other writers and storytellers have influenced you?</b></p>
<p>Ah, yes. “A choker of rubies, two inches wide, like an extraordinarily precious slit throat… the flashing crimson jewels… bright as arterial blood.” That image is so vivid and terrible and beautiful. I do love Angela Carter’s work very much, but I came to her a bit later that one might expect. My literary education was sort of fragmented and weird; it was almost entirely self-directed (neither of my parents were big readers; I didn’t major in literature in college) and thus contained large gaps that I’ve only recently amended.</p>
<p>For example, I once wrote a story that an entire workshop identified as heavily influenced by Shirley Jackson. At first, I was confused by this comment, because I hadn’t read a stitch of Shirley Jackson beyond “The Lottery” in high school. But what I later concluded was that I’d read a lot of writers who were influenced by Shirley Jackson; so I was getting her fragmented, filtered influence.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I have read and am obsessed with Angela Carter and Shirley Jackson both. Other writers who influence my work: Patricia Highsmith, Jane Bowles, Muriel Sparks, Kelly Link, Karen Russell, Yoko Ogawa, Kazuo Ishiguro, Gloria Naylor, Gabriel García Márquez, Nicholson Baker, Kevin Brockmeier, Michelle Huneven, Michel Faber, Joyce Carol Oates, Helen Oyeyemi, Ann Patchett, Virginia Woolf, Jeanette Winterson, Sarah Waters, Michael Chabon, Alissa Nutting, Andrea Barrett, Chris Adrian, Ray Bradbury… I could go on forever.</p>
<p><b>“The Husband Stitch” is peppered with instructions that tell the reader how to share the story out loud, should they want to do so. These instructions gesture at traditions of oral storytelling. Why did you decide to include these instructions? What do you think they bring to &#8220;The Husband Stitch&#8221;? </b></p>
<p>When I was a Girl Scout, we’d go on this annual autumn camping trip in the Pocono Mountains. I sort of loved and hated it—I hated how cold and dark it was. I hated bugs. I hated the latrine. But I was enamored with the campfire—telling stories around it, eating food cooked in it, throwing various objects into it to see how they burned. (My favorite: a half-filled Dixie cup, which immediately burned down to the water line. Then the wax on the exterior blistered, and the contents bubbled and boiled for what seemed like forever, burned off, and then the entire thing was consumed by the flames.)</p>
<p>I was a really weird kid, and didn’t get along with the girls my age. But I was a good storyteller—theatrical, dramatic, effusive—and I loved telling tales around the campfire. So the first time I read the <i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i> series—which included a story where a ghost’s question, “Who’s got my money? Whoooo? Whoooo?” is followed by instructions for the storyteller to grab someone and yell “YOU’VE GOT IT!”—I became obsessed with the idea of the story crossing over into the real world. Which I did, the next chance I got. It was exactly as fun and exciting as I’d imagined. (And, bonus, I got to make a fellow Girl Scout cry. An artist is born!)</p>
<p>So of course, as I was working on “The Husband Stitch,” I got the idea to fold in warped narrative instructions. It does all kinds of interesting work: breaks down the wall between the story and the reader, invokes a tradition of oral storytelling, reinforces the story’s danger as real and literal, enables further commentary on gender, and is also just plain fun.</p>
<p>After I published “The Husband Stitch,” I received a bit of fan mail in which the writer told me that they had read this passage:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;">(If you are reading this story out loud, move aside the curtain to illustrate this final point to your listeners. It’ll be raining, I promise.)</p>
<p>And then felt compelled to push aside their living room curtain. And it was raining. And it blew their mind. Knowing that has happened <i>even once</i> fills me with incomprehensible amounts of joy.</p>
