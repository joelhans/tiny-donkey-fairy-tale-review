<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ram_Devineni.jpg"><img class="wp-image-601 aligncenter" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ram_Devineni-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="249" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ram_Devineni-300x169.jpg 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ram_Devineni-768x432.jpg 768w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ram_Devineni-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" /></a><i>Ram Devineni is a filmmaker, publisher, and the founder of </i><a href="http://www.rattapallax.com"><i>Rattapallax</i></a><i> films and magazine. His films include the documentaries </i>The Human Tower (2012)<i> and </i>The Russian Woodpecker (2015)<i>,</i> <i>which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. Devineni is also the creator of </i><a href="http://www.priyashakti.com">Priya’s Shakti</a><i>, an augmented-reality comic book series featuring a superhero who fights gender-based violence in India. </i>Priya’s Shakti<i> was inspired by the gang rape and death in New Delhi in 2012 of a young woman returning home on a bus at night after seeing a movie with a male friend. The crime sparked protests across India as well as conversations about gender-based violence, patriarchy, and victim-blaming. In </i>Priya’s Shakti<i>, Priya is a young woman attacked by a group of men who finds her power (shakti) to help other survivors with the aid of the Hindu god and goddess Shiva and Parvati and a tiger companion. In the comic’s sequel, </i>Priya’s Mirror<i>, Priya uses a mirror to free a group of acid attack survivors held prisoner by an acid-green demon-king, Ahankar, who himself has become imprisoned by toxic masculinity. In addition to rich and colorful illustrations and mythological characters, the comics feature augmented-reality technology that brings to life the stories and voices of real women who’ve survived gender-based violence. Intrigued by this extraordinary project, I contacted Devineni to find out more about the Hindu, Indian, and mythological elements of the Priya series.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Why did you decide to create this comic series? There seem to be many different people and groups involved. Can you describe their different roles and contributions?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although I am the creator of this project, I really consider this a team effort. Everyone played a valuable part in the creation of the comic book and project. I met [artist] Dan Goldman at a StoryCode Meetup in New York City, and [we] hit it off on the spot. I think he signed on the next day. Dan is a remarkable artist and philosopher&#8211;he has brought a new perspective and look to the Hindu gods. His design is based on deep respect and affection for Hindu mythology and the power of the image. Each page is a stand-alone painting that can be mounted in a gallery. [Producer] Lina [Srivastava] has vast experience creating social impact strategies for documentary films and art projects. She has been instrumental in developing partnerships with major NGOs. She recently set up a partnership between the project and Apne Aap Women Worldwide&#8211;one of India’s leading NGOs supporting at-risk girls and women by ensuring them access to their rights, and to deter the purchase of sex through policy and social change. Vikas K. Menon co-wrote “Priya’s Shakti” and Paromita Vohra co-wrote “Priya’s Mirror.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the backstory of how the comic book started:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was in Delhi when the horrible gang rape happened on the bus in 2012, and was involved [in] the protests that soon followed. Like many people, I was horrified by what had happened and angered by the indifference exhibited by government authorities at every level. There was an enormous outcry in particular from young adults and teenagers&#8211;both women and men. At one of the protests, my colleague and I spoke to a Delhi police officer and asked him for his opinion on what had happened on the bus. Basically the officer’s response was that “no good girl walks home at night.” Implying that she probably deserved it, or at least provoked the attack. I knew then that the problem of sexual violence in India was not a legal issue; rather it was a cultural problem. A cultural shift had to happen, especially views towards the role of women in modern society. Deep-rooted patriarchal views needed to be challenged.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For about a year, I traveled around India and Southeast Asia learning from poets, philosophers, activists, and sociologists working for NGOs focused on gender-based violence. Talking with several rape survivors, I realized how difficult it was for them to seek justice and how much their lives were constantly under threat after they reported the crime. Their family, local community, and even the police discouraged them from pursuing criminal action against their attackers. The burden of shame was placed on the victim and not the perpetrators. This created a level of impunity among men to commit more rapes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-599"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>How do the Priya comics reflect traditional Hindu and Indian beliefs and legends? How do they challenge them?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted to use constructs that already exist in India and also use popular mythological stories to address this problem. I began researching Hindu mythology and discovered the many rich stories involving regular people and the gods. Often a favorite disciple would call on the gods for help during dire situations. So, I began formulating a new mythological tale where a mortal woman and rape survivor would seek help from the Goddess Parvati&#8211;only after she had nowhere else to turn. Although Lord Shiva and other gods get involved, eventually it is up to her to challenge people’s perceptions. I wanted to create a new Indian “superhero”&#8211;Priya, who is a rape survivor, and through the power of persuasion she is able to motivate people to change. Priya is the catalyst for change. Not the gods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion, the core essence of Hinduism is about conquering your fears. In the story, Priya confronts the tiger that has been stalking her. She turns her fear, the tiger, into her power&#8211;her shakti. Also mythology is the story of us. In Hindu mythology, Parvati is the goddess that challenges Shiva, the other gods, and humans to open their eyes to sensitivity and struggles of others. For her, wisdom is meaningless if it does not enable the liberation of those who are trapped in fear. So, her role is to challenge Priya to conquer her fears, but it is up to Priya to motivate and challenge other humans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Is Priya a more assertive character than most female Indian and Hindu characters or is she typical? Was her character inspired by film and other comic book heroines or by mythological heroines?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Priya is influenced by my interviews with rape survivors, but on a mythological level, she is an alternative representation of the Goddess Durga. Durga is the ultimate goddess of feminine power and empowerment, and she rides a tiger. We subverted that image by putting a rape survivor (Priya) on a tiger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priya2.png"><img class=" wp-image-606 aligncenter" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priya2-300x275.png" alt="priya2" width="457" height="419" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priya2-300x275.png 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priya2-768x704.png 768w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priya2-1024x938.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px" /></a><b></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Why are there gods and goddesses (Shiva and Parvati) as characters in these stories? Were they included to bring a higher moral authority to the comics? Or just to make a more colorful story?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Hindu gods have an important meaning in the comic book. Shiva is removed from human society, and is deep in meditation. At first he is unable to empathize with the sufferings of humans, but it is through Parvati that he changes from an “insensitive angry god into Shankara, the god who empathizes and is patient” (<a href="http://devdutt.com/books/7-secrets-of-shiva.html">Devdutt Pattanaik’s “The Seven Secrets of Shiva”</a>). Shiva eventually believes that the human race can change, and allows Parvati to instill “shakti” into Priya, who then becomes the catalyst for change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, the Goddess Parvati is the awakening light in Priya and Shiva; the Goddess wants Shiva and the human race to empathize with Priya and other survivors of rape. She motivates Priya to conquer her fears and find her shakti and be the catalyst for change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Devdutt Pattanaik’s book “The Seven Secrets of Shiva,” he writes: “That is why the Goddess stands in opposition of Shiva as both the radiant Gauri, producing light, and as the dark Kali, consuming light…She hopes to change Shiva the insensitive angry god into Shankara, the god who empathizes and is patient.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>“Priya’s Mirror” focuses more on men’s responsibilities in fighting gender-based violence than “Priya’s Shakti.” Can you talk about the demon-king character, Ahankar? Is he based on anyone in Indian mythology? How did his character develop?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahankar is an unusual and complex villain. He is born of acid and is a victim too. He is given a boon by Lord Shiva to either purify the acid he was forced to drink or make it more potent and dangerous. Unfortunately he chooses the latter. He feels he is a benevolent and caring King by hiding women who have survived acid attacks in his castle and away from the real world. He does not realize that by doing this, he is actually entrapping them in their fears and depression. We wanted to a show a male character who is also a victim of patriarchy. Patriarchy and indifference affects everyone. There is no direct influence in creating Ahankar, but characters like him are common motifs in Hindu mythology. A classical example is the demon-king Ravana in the Hindu epic Ramayana.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>“Priya’s Mirror” also includes the stories of women other than Priya who have survived acts of gender-based violence, namely acid attacks. I think this is an interesting element because so many fairy tale and folklore collections have involved asking local people in a community to contribute their own experiences or stories passed down in their families. How were these women’s stories collected for “Priya’s Mirror”?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last December 2015 I was in Delhi presenting the comic book at the Delhi Comic Con, and I had the chance to meet Sonia [Chowdhary] and Laxmi [Agarwal] with Stop Acid Attacks in their office. What I discovered after talking with them is that they faced the same cultural stigmas and reactions from society that rape survivors had to endure. How society treated them intensified the problem and their recovery. How they were treated by their family, neighbors, and society determined what they did next. Often they were treated like the villains and the blame was put on them. Our comic book focuses on this and tries to changes people’s perceptions of these heroic women. The comic book’s main character is Priya who is a survivor of gang rape and we wanted to continue her movement and adventures and by focusing on acid-attacks allowed her story and character to evolve. The correlations were too obvious and imperative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I spoke with Sonia and Laxmi with Stop Acid Attacks in December 2015 and later with Monica Singh with the Mahendra Singh Foundation and Natalia in Colombia with Natalia Ponce de León Foundation. They all helped to create the characters and story. Here are their short videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Onj3hAimP8">Sonia</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CawlbbYRT4I">Monica</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RDpOzmzne0">Laxmi</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OemhDkgBBo">Natalia</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priyas_mirrors_heroes.jpg"><img class="wp-image-610 aligncenter" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priyas_mirrors_heroes-300x141.jpg" alt="priyas_mirrors_heroes" width="528" height="248" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priyas_mirrors_heroes-300x141.jpg 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priyas_mirrors_heroes-768x361.jpg 768w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priyas_mirrors_heroes-1024x482.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What is in the future for Priya? Any more stories in the series? Is there any chance Priya’s adventures will make the leap from augmented reality to TV or film in the future?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next chapter is about sex trafficking, and we are working with Apne Aap Women Worldwide to develop the story. Dan and I were in Kolkata [in November] and interviewed exploited women in the red light areas. The story will be co-written with Emmy Award winner and advocate and founder of Apne Aap, Ruchira Gupta. The research is funded by the Jerome Foundation and we hope to release it in a year. We are looking into doing an animated short film, but financially it’s super expensive and we feel we get more impact continuing the comic book series.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Last, what is your favorite Hindu or Indian fairy tale or folk tale and why?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a kid, I always loved the story of Ganesha. He is a fun and adorable deity whose story really resonates with kids. Also he is the god of good fortune, so all Hindus pray to him.</p>

<p><strong>A note for readers: this essay mentions sexual violence.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff.jpg"><img class="wp-image-576 alignright" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff-215x300.jpg" alt="bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff" width="313" height="437" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff-215x300.jpg 215w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /></a>In folklore, the term “transformation chase” refers to the use of shapeshifting as a means of combat or escape. The wizard duel in the animated film <em>The Sword In The Stone</em>, for one, but more traditionally the plot of several Celtic ballads. &#8220;The Ballad of Tam-Lin&#8221; was included in a book of folktales I had as a child, translated from song to prose. I remember loving it. I remember the way the name “Tam-Lin” felt on my Russian tongue, liquid and strong. For those unfamiliar with the story, it goes like this: a girl comes upon Tam-Lin in the woods of Carterhaugh, where he is being held prisoner by the Queen of Fairies. To rescue him from the Queen and win him as a lover, the girl must hold him fast through countless transformations: a roaring lion, a terrifying snake, the painful scald of flame. To my young sensibilities, this seemed extremely romantic. I appreciated the ritual of endurance; trials and pageantry were a necessity of love stories because some outside force willed it, not because of the lovers themselves. Years later, &#8220;The Ballad of Tam-Lin&#8221; made me pissed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Granted, what sounds romantic to a four-year-old-girl can hardly be expected to ring true to a thirty-year-old non binary queer person. All the same, I wanted to slice apart this story with my feminist lance — which is like a feminist lens, but for folktales. The basic premise of &#8220;Tam-Lin,&#8221; where a woman holds a man as he hurts her, was no longer abstract but a common narrative played out through a million books and films fetishizing a woman’s abnegation and self-sacrifice for the sake of a man’s potential. &#8220;Tam-Lin&#8221; became our culture’s unfortunate connection between pain and love, equating the latter with a willingness to suffer on behalf of another. “It’s only true if you bruise by the force of it,” as Chris Corner once said. Fuck. What had originally drawn me to such a sexist, heteronormative depiction of devotion? A poem from my poetry collection,<em> Salt Is For Curing</em>, tried to understand: “She holds and she hurts and / she wins. Maybe I liked it because the woman / is doing something, not waiting. It&#8217;s always / either waiting or hurting, you know, and often / one can’t tell the difference.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet the more I thought about it, the more &#8220;The Ballad of Tam-Lin&#8221; seemed itself to change shape, to become something other than what I had previously seen. As I looked back on an extremely difficult period of my life when I frequently lashed out in anger and attempted to isolate myself from those around me — and as I thought about the people who remained by my side throughout this — I began to see &#8220;Tam-Lin&#8221; not as a patriarchal narrative of pain-acceptance but as one where a character holds another through change. Tam-Lin did not become a flame and slowly burn hotter; he shifted indiscriminately, the changes done to him as he assumed monstrous forms akin to those in body-horror films like <em>The Fly</em> or <em>Tusk</em>. The transformation chase in &#8220;Tam-Lin&#8221; is a battle against the Fairy Queen and not really between the two individuals. In this forest, the courage required in love is made literal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be forcibly changed, especially as a means of achieving freedom, is a strong metaphor that does double-duty here: the girl can leave the forest and head home any time, but enduring the transformations is the only way for Tam-Lin to escape the Fairy Queen. Someone we love can certainly assume different shapes to frighten or hurt us, but the experiences that make us shift and change are as varied as all the animals in the wood of Carterhaugh. Which is to say: is it possible that there is something beautiful in love’s tenacity? Not in the sense that it’s good or admirable to endure pain, but in the sense that a transformation chase represents the monstrous qualities people display as they pass through tragedy — the qualities we might take on during the processing of grief or trauma. This link of change with pain, especially in the context of external pain (vis-à-vis the Fairy Queen), is in some ways a very honest look at any long-term relationship, where we must each see the other’s wounds and mold each other back into, if not our perfect form, then at least something passable. A transformation chase is not discomfort for the sake of another but the choice to remain by their side in a moment of shared discomfort — because, after all, it is only in fairy tales that change can happen with something as easy as a kiss.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>There&#8217;s a storied tradition of studying fairy tales through a feminist lens, but you take that work further, examining queerness in fairy tales. How did you find your way into this field of research?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Absolutely my queer/trans research is an extension of my feminist research! But my route to queer and trans fairy tales was circuitous. I started a masters in Folklore at Memorial University in St. John’s, Newfoundland in 1977. At the time, and to a sad extent now, the cool kids avoided traditionally recognised forms of folklore like ballads and fairy tales. Trying to be one of them, I did my masters thesis on family photography.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, when I got to the University of Texas at Austin in 1981, where I did my PhD, I worked with Roger deV. Renwick, a ballad and folk song scholar who has always been an advocate for studying traditional genres (see e.g. Renwick 1980 and 2009). So for my PhD dissertation on folk poetry in Ontario under Roger’s supervision, I was looking for the old in the new, as it were (Greenhill 1989).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After five years teaching Canadian Studies at the University of Waterloo, I came to the University of Winnipeg’s (then) Women’s Studies program in 1991. (We’re now a Department with six full time faculty and we’ve included “and Gender.”) At the time I was working on Newfoundland ballads about women who dress as men to follow their lovers or seek adventure as sailors, soldiers, or robbers. You can listen to one example <a href="http://tidido.com/a35184374041547/al55f091c6a5f39075733cc084/t55f091c7a5f39075733cc127">here</a>, sung by the fabulous Newfoundland traditional source singer Anita Best on the compilation album <i>Bristol’s Hope&#8211;Lately Come Over</i>. Hitherto folklorists’ readings assumed that these songs were about men and their experiences, and my feminist reading asserted that they were also about women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-540"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, when I talked to my undergraduate feminist theory class, telling them my idea that these songs expressed possibilities for women to control their own libidinal and reproductive economy (that is, to choose their own sex partners/husbands rather than having the partner chosen by their father as is most common in ballads), the students pointed out alternatives to my heteronormative interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Specifically, I didn’t take into account the fact that these songs often circled around the drama of a man declaring love for and/or suggesting sex with the cross dresser, apparently thinking she was male; or a woman declaring love and/or suggesting sex, unaware that she was attracted to a woman. Following the students’ lead, my first queering of traditional culture ventured that these ballads were (also) about same-sex attraction (Greenhill 1995). I have since continued to queer, and later to explore transgender expression in, traditional ballads (Greenhill 2014).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fairy tales entered the mix when I invited my friend, colleague, and co-conspirator in feminist and queer folklore Kay Turner to teach an intensive feminist folklore course at the University of Winnipeg in 1997. Kay decided to offer a few classes on the Grimms’ fairy tales, and again our fabulous Women’s Studies students were influential! They read the stories anew, reflecting upon them from their own queer locations. Kay and I were fascinated and resolved to do a book incorporating these interpretations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Transgressive Tales: Queering the Grimms </i>(Turner and Greenhill 2012) was 15 years in the making. Part of the problem was the difficulty of finding folklorists in the late 1990s who were willing to venture a queer reading of traditional fairy tales! Then, just as we were getting ready to finalise our plans, 9/11 happened. Kay was working as the folklorist for the Brooklyn Arts Council and turned all her attention toward documenting and recording people’s personal and aesthetic responses. By the middle of the decade, I was despairing of our chances of ever getting the book going, so I submitted my paper on “Fitcher’s (Queer) Bird” (ATU 311) to <i>Marvels &amp; Tales</i>, and they accepted it (2008).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, Kay and I resolved that we had to complete that transgressing! We proposed <i>Transgressive Tales </i>to Wayne State University Press’s Series in Fairy Tale Studies and they accepted. With a combination of work from seasoned scholars and from students, we looked at some literary rewritings, but also at traditional stories. For my own contribution, I managed to sneak in a Canadian fairy tale&#8211;“Peg Bearskin” in Newfoundland and “La Poiluse” in Francophone northern Ontario&#8211;about a gutsy, masculine-looking and -acting young woman who saves her sisters, seeks adventures and impossible tasks, and eventually marries a prince and magically transforms (herself) into a more feminine presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think reading these archetypal stories through a queer lens is important?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I like to use the insights of film theorist Alexander Doty on “queering” cinema, because they apply to nearly everything else also. The concept of queering too often “implies taking a thing that is straight and doing something to it” (2000, 2). Doty points out that heterosexual readings are conventionally presumed to be intrinsic, where queer and trans readings, then, must necessarily be taking an already-straight text and rendering it queer&#8211;an additive process, a reading-into, a twisting. Doty disagrees with that perspective, and so do I. We presume that texts have no essential sex, gender, or sexuality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certainly a lot of fairy tales look superficially straight (especially as redacted by those who bring their Christian, heteronormative perspectives, like the Brothers Grimm). Many focus on heterosexual marriage&#8211;either as an ending for men or as the beginning of women’s troubles! (discussed by Holbek 1987). However, sometimes one can be absolutely flabbergasted by how close to the surface queerness is; a lot of fairy tales really work well to undermine heteronormative presumptions. To quote Lewis Seifert, one of the first American scholars to start outing fairy tales, in his introduction to the recent special issue of <i>Marvels &amp; Tales</i>, called “Queer(ing) Fairy Tales,” a lot of times we find “erotic innuendo hiding in plain sight” (2015, 17)&#8211;and, I would add, queer and trans content similarly hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How could I NOT have seen the gay/lesbian/trans elements in those cross-dressing ballads? Because everything I’d learned growing up straight, and being intellectually formed in the discipline of folklore in the 1970s and 1980s, taught me to simply gloss over them! How can we NOT see a fairy tale type called “The Shift of Sex” (ATU 514), in which a woman transforms into man, as being about transgender expression (Greenhill and Anderson-Grégoire 2014)? What’s NOT queer about a story about a boy born half human, half hedgehog, who rides off on his shod cock (Greenhill 2014a)? Why should pointing out lesbian elements in a story like Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Snow Queen”&#8211;like Little Robber Girl kissing and sleeping with Gerda, so thoroughly overplayed especially in male directors’ live action films of the tale (Greenhill 2015)&#8211;seem anything other than obvious? In part because we’re taught that fairy tales are for kids, who are of course (wrongly!) presumed to be sexuality-free, its queer/trans content (presumed X-rated) seems invisible/impossible! And because, as Doty pointed out, the presumption that everyone and everything is always heterosexual prevails. But once you start looking&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your favorite fairy tale and why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> I confess to being a bit fickle in my fairy-tale loves. When I was working on “Fitcher’s Bird,” I was smitten. Then “Peg Bearskin/La Poiluse” called me, and “The Shift of Sex,” and “Hans My Hedgehog” (ATU 411). Lately in my fairy-tale film research I’ve branched out to include literary fairy tales, and I was watching and writing about cinema based on Andersen’s “The Snow Queen.” I was fascinated by the differences I saw between male directors’ readings of the story and the sexualities involved, and those of four (feminist) women directors (Greenhill 2016).</p>
<p>But the only fairy tale I actually tell&#8211;teaching is my usual performance&#8211;is a version of “The Robber Bridegroom” (ATU 955). I first heard it told by The Folktellers at the <a href="http://winnipegfolkfestival.ca/folk-fest/">Winnipeg Folk Festival</a>, a long time ago. There’s so much to love in that story. It’s a thriller&#8211;the story-within-a-story that the hero/ine uses to save themself; the triple incremental repetition “Be bold!” “Be bold, be bold!” “Be bold, be bold, but not so bold, lest that your heart’s blood should run cold.” I so appreciate the horror moments in fairy tales&#8211;especially when, as in “Fitcher’s Bird,” “Peg Bearskin,” “The Shift of Sex,” and of course “The Robber Bridegroom,” the sister, usually the younger sister, like me, eventually prevails.</p>
<p><strong>What have you been working on recently?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My colleagues Jill Terry Rudy, Naomi Hamer, Lauren Bosc and I are co-editing the<i> Routledge Companion to Fairy-Tale Cultures and Media</i>. I’ve promised a monograph called <i>Species of Magic and Wonder: Transgender, Transbiology, and Transformation in Fairy-Tale Media </i>to the Wayne State University Press Series in Fairy-Tale Studies. My colleagues Martin Lovelace, Anita Best and I are doing <i>“The Maid in the Thick of the Well”: Gender and the Magic Tales of Alice Lannon and Pius Power Senior</i>, a book on the ten magic tales collected from two Newfoundland source tellers. I’ve applied for a grant to do more on justice issues and fairy-tale media with Canadian and international colleagues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://iftf.uwinnipeg.ca/">The International Fairy-Tale Filmography online</a> needs constant updating. And I want to do more on two films: <i>Celestial Clockwork </i>(directed by Fina Torres, 1995), a lesbian/gay/queer transnational version of “Cinderella” (ATU 510A) about a Venezuelan mezzo-soprano in Paris trying to get the lead role in a film of Rossini’s <i>La Cenerentola</i>; and<i> The Fall</i> (directed by Tarsem Singh, 2006), another story-in-story story which explores storytelling and is visually amazing, having been filmed in more than 20 countries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m hoping to do more participant-observation on film sites with the fabulous women from <a href="http://www.redczarina.com/">Red Czarina</a>. Director Danishka Esterhazy welcomed a student research assistant and me to the set of <a href="http://www.hg-movie.com/"><i>H &amp; G </i></a>, a “Hansel and Gretel” (ATU 327A) film centring on Winnipeg and the surrounding countryside. It was a fantastic experience to see a movie being made. Danishka is in post-production on <i>The Singing Bones</i>, based on Francesca Lia Block’s “Beauty and the Beast” (ATU 425C) short story called “Bones.” Rebecca Gibson will be directing “Jane Garbage,” a modern “Cinderella” story. And check out Danishka’s earlier fairy tale films, <a href="http://www.danishkaesterhazy.com/portfolio/the-snow-queen/"><i>The Snow Queen </i></a>and <a href="http://www.danishkaesterhazy.com/portfolio/the-red-hood/">The Red Hood</a>&#8211;a riff on “Little Red Riding Hood” (ATU 333).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So much has been done on film since Sidney Eve Matrix and I did <i>Fairy Tale Films: Visions of Ambiguity </i>(2010) and Jack Zipes’s <i>The Enchanted Screen: The Unknown History of Fairy Tale Films </i>(2011) came out. (I have to give a shout out to Jack who has been an amazing supporter, mentor, and collaborator.  Thanks, Jack!) And many new fairy-tale films have come out, which I’m dying to share with the wonderful Women’s and Gender Studies students&#8211;and of course all the other students&#8211;at the University of Winnipeg. I’m hoping to teach a fairy-tale film course in Fall 2017 and screen some films I’ve encountered recently as well as some old favourites. My students loved <i>The Wolves of Kromer </i>(directed by Will Gould, 1998), a sweet film using “Little Red Riding Hood” to reflect on homophobia. And of course, all the cool new theory and analysis, including Anne Duggan’s (2013) work on Jacques Demy’s fairy tale films and Cristina Bacchilega’s (2013) de-colonising reflection on the transnational fairy tale web.</p>

You are a girl, and where there is a girl there is a story. A story about a girl.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your mother will give you a bag. Maybe a fine leather satchel, or maybe a rough sack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It will be much heavier than it appears.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your mother cannot speak, so she cross-stitches her warning to you. Her thimbled finger pushes the needle that pulls the thread. She spells it out so you see her words framed by pine above your pillow. Each day you wake to them, and each night you bed down beneath them:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Do not go into the deep dark woods alone.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You hear the story of your mother from the women of the village, so often that you know it by heart. The old wives tell their tale. Your ears grow heavy to carry. Sometimes the women are raccoons chittering, sometimes birds wide-beaked and screeching grief. You want quiet. You want dark. You want to be alone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You set off carrying your mother’s bag.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From inside the wolf’s belly, you don’t hear the old wives at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Still. You know their story, by heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Your mother lost her voice to the jaws of a wolf. She went into the deep dark woods alone, with her basket in hand. She was plucking mushrooms from the good rot when the wolf came upon her. He caught her by the neck. At the last moment, a hunter saved her. He drove his knife through the beast’s belly. Soon you grew in hers. The hunter built your house. The hunter brought meat. But the hunter did too break your mother’s bones.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From inside the wolf’s belly, you can hear the hunters swarm for rescue. You stay very quiet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They will leave, with their knives and axes and arrows. You will begin to chew.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You are a girl, and where there is a girl there is a story. A story about a girl.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old wives will tell this story of you:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The girl went into the deep dark woods alone, chasing her shadow. The wolf had pale yellow eyes and a black smile. He gulped her down whole. But the girl ate the wolf from inside his own belly. She ripped and chewed and swallowed until the beast was inside her belly instead, every last sharp tooth of him. She belched. She howled and barked at the moon.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You. You will whisper to the wolf inside you:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>You ought not have gone into the deep dark woods alone.</em></p>

<p><em>I lived in Appalachia for four years, and it&#8217;s there that I encountered&#8211;and fell in love with&#8211;Appalachian ballad singing. Sparse and haunting, ballads are usually sung without instrumentation and tell melancholy tales of betrayal and lost love. Many draw on traditional literature&#8211;like folklore and fairy tales&#8211;and the medieval romance tradition. I wanted to know more, so I asked my friend <a href="http://www.sarosings.com/">Saro Lynch-Thomason</a>, a folklorist and ballad singer, a few questions.</em></p>
<p><em>Lynch-Thomason&#8211;who is based in Asheville, North Carolina&#8211;is also an illustrator, author, and social activist. In 2012 she completed </em><a href="http://www.blairpathways.com/">Blair Pathways: A Musical Exploration of America’s Largest Labor Uprising</a><em>&#8211;a researched compilation of over 20 historic songs from West Virginia’s labor wars. Saro has led the Asheville Community Sing since 2010 and regularly teaches regional ballad workshops, Wassailing choruses, and May Day choruses on social justice themes. In 2013, Saro completed her solo CD </em><a href="https://sarolyncht.bandcamp.com/album/vessel">Vessel</a><em>&#8211;an acappella compilation of ballads and songs from Appalachia and the British Isles. Her distinct, powerful singing style transports audiences to Appalachian mountain hollers, 19th-century coal camps and old meeting houses.</em></p>
<p>(As a heads up, this interview mentions sexual assault.)</p>
<p><strong>Ballad singing traveled from the British Isles to Appalachia, where you live. Can you tell me a little bit about ballad singing, how it originated and how it ended up in the U.S. Mountain South?</strong></p>
<p>Ballads as they are often referred to today reference a particular story-song form that has been in Europe for nearly 1,000 years. Often a ballad involves first or third person narration, a simple rhyme scheme and a repeated melody. In the 1100s and 1200s, this form of storytelling was popular across what is modern-day France and Spain. A class of minstrels, supported by nobility, traveled and composed poetry and songs in this format. Over 2,000 poems have survived from this period, along with hundreds of melodies.</p>
<p>Since then there have been several periods of songwriting popularity, during which everyone from nobles to peasants took an interest in creating and singing their own ballads. Many ballads were written in the Middle Ages, about 300 of which survive today. But many ballads come from a revival period that began in the 1600s and had its heyday with the creation of the letterpress. People wrote and dispersed songs across Europe and America, drawing on old melodies and themes but with updated characters and political messaging.</p>
<p>During this period many ballads came to America, brought by immigrants from England, Ireland, and Scotland who arrived throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Immigrants families carried and adapted these songs for generations as they worked and settled across the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, the Piedmont in North Carolina, and the Appalachian Mountains. These song styles became dispersed into Afro-Appalachian communities as well, where people continued to change them.</p>
<p><span id="more-355"></span></p>
<p><strong>How did you become interested in ballads? What has your journey studying, singing and teaching ballads been like?</strong></p>
<p>Growing up in Nashville, TN, my parents played music from the British folk revival of the 60s and 70s alongside contemporary composers who drew from traditional sources&#8211;singers like Sinead O’Connor and Loreena McKennitt. I latched on to the ballads I heard and spent time by myself memorizing them. In addition, my aunts had learned many ballads in the folk revival era, and taught me songs from their repertoire.</p>
<p>When I attended college in the Northeast I met other people my age who studied and sang ballads. Having peers who were just as interested in these songs as I was encouraged me to learn more. After school I moved to Western North Carolina to connect with the many traditional singing communities there, and I’ve been studying ballads ever since.</p>
<p>The process of hearing a ballad, learning it, and teaching it has always felt very emotional and spiritual to me. Knowing that a song has been carried from body to body for generations is a powerful thing. A song has to really resonate with many people in order for it to be passed and remembered and cherished for long periods of time. When I sing a ballad, I feel like I’m not only inheriting the song but the community of people who have sung it. I have an invisible circle of folks who affirm my feelings and connection to the song’s content. Getting to teach these songs to others, and learning what the stories mean to them, is a rewarding and revelatory experience.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of stories do ballads tell? How do ballads relate to traditional forms of literature, like folk and fairy tales?</strong></p>
<p>Ballads can tell just about every kind of story. They’ve been used to spread news, to teach moral lessons, as political propaganda, as escapist fantasies, and as fatalistic laments. Since these story songs have been around since at least the 1100s, it’s impossible to generalize what they tell about. Different eras do seem to have had favored themes, though. In America, for example, popular ballad themes have included murders (often based on real events), cowboy tales, betrayed love, and train wrecks. In the 1600s and 1700s in England many ballads detailed the dramas of the nobility (sort of like modern-day tabloids), lamented sailors’ deaths at sea, and celebrated famous battles.</p>
<p>For as long as these songs have been around they’ve enjoyed a close relationship with literature. Starting in the same period that medieval minstrelsy was popular across Europe&#8211;the 1100s&#8211; there was a literary form popular among nobility called romance writing. Nobles and aristocracy would write stories inspired by legends and older histories, using prose and verse forms. Over time people truncated these stories, added a tune, and started singing them. In turn, these ballads could eventually inspire new poetry or novels.</p>
<p>A great example of the interweaving of literary and musical storytelling can be seen in the Thomas of Erceldoune legend. Thomas of Erceldoune was a Scottish lord in the 1200s. According to legend, he was a seer and prophet, and is also credited with writing the English version of the romance “Tristram and Isolde”- a precursor to the Lancelot and Guinevere legend. Erceldoune passed away in the late 1200s, and about one hundred years later someone decided to write a romance praising his abilities. The narrative is written from Thomas’ perspective, and explains that he received his gifts of prophecy from a fairy queen. By the 1700s, this romance had become a ballad. The first verse of many versions says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">True Thomas lay on Huntlie bank,<br />
A ferlie he spied wi’ his ee,<br />
And there he saw a lady bright,<br />
Come riding down by the Eildon Tree.</p>
<p>Thomas spies a “ferlie” with his “ee,” or “eye. In the Scots language a “ferlie” is a “wonder,” in this case the wondrous site of the fairy queen approaching Thomas to take him to her realm.</p>
<p>During the same period this song was popular, a literary ballad revival was taking place in Europe. Aristocratic scholars and writers began to collect and study ballads, using them as inspiration for poetry. One of these artists, Sir Walter Scott, collected the Thomas ballad and wrote his own third part to the narrative, extending the story and reviving interest in the singing of the ballad.</p>
<p>The song seems to have made its way to America, and was written down in the mid-1900s from a version sung by a woman named Becky Gordon in Western North Carolina. Her first verse reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">True Thomas lay on yonder hill<br />
And saw a lady gay<br />
A lady that was bright and fair<br />
Come riding down the way</p>
<p>I found this ballad in a collection of North Carolina folklore and added my own tune since it had none. I’ve been singing it for a few years now. To me, it’s a “ferlie” that a story like True Thomas has been around for so long, and I think its survival and popularity is due to the fact that it has taken literary forms many times.</p>
<p>Some people argue that if a ballad is written down, it begins to die&#8211;that putting the narrative to paper means people will stop knowing it and holding it in their minds and memory. I think the history of Thomas of Erceldoune demonstrates that the relationship between written stories and sung stories is natural and mutually beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>You’re interested in the sociopolitical dimensions of ballad singing. How does your work with ballads – as well as the ballads themselves&#8211; relate to issues like feminism, economic justice, and environmental destruction in Appalachia?</strong></p>
<p>Ballads have a powerful political dimension to them&#8211;they can be used to push against cultural expectations or to affirm them. Which meaning a ballad has is often up to the interpretation of the singers and listeners.</p>
<p>I’ve been teaching workshops for a while that focus on women’s experiences in ballads. Some of the stories in ballads are about the hardest experiences women go through&#8211;like economic disenfranchisement, abortion and sexual assault. In some ballads women face these challenges and find creative solutions to overcome them, and in others they simply have to bear the weight of these traumas. In my workshops, I’ve been exploring how these kinds of stories can be viewed as empowering in the right context. For example, a song that I’ve enjoyed singing to myself for years is called simply “Queen Jane.” The ballad is about a rape, and I’ve sung it to myself, alone, countless times as a way to emotionally process my experiences of sexual assault. It’s such an intense song that I would have trouble hearing or sharing it in a public space, but the solitary practice of singing it has been a great comfort to me. Whoever originally wrote “Queen Jane” may not have had that use in mind for the song, but that’s how ballads work&#8211;the songs survive because they take on personal meanings to people. This use of ballads as processing tools for traumatic experiences is profound and moving to me as a feminist and activist.</p>
<p>As an organizer in Appalachia, I’ve enjoyed using ballads as overtly political statements. A lot of European songs from hundreds of years ago speak to the same issues Appalachians are facing today, including <a href="http://content.sierraclub.org/coal/mining-destroying-mountains">environmental destruction </a>and lack of access to land. English ballads about the enclosure of the commons could easily describe <a href="http://auroralights.org/map_project/theme.php?theme=coal_river_101&amp;article=14">the modern state of private land ownership</a> in Appalachia. Some of these older songs also tell about rebellions and land reclamation movements, suggesting strategies that could be used today.</p>
<p>One of my favorite political ballads is an adaptation of an English song called &#8220;The Cutty Wren.” The song is thought to have originally been a coded rebel song about killing the king and dispersing his riches. One of the characters in the song declares, “We’ll shoot the cutty wren!” &#8212; the wren being a longtime symbol of kings and rulers. In the new version, adapted by ballad singer and Appalachian activist Michael Kline, the song details the plans of a group of people to blow up a bulldozer on a strip site. The same character declares, “We’ll blow the big dozer!”</p>
<p>Appalachians have taken older songs like this and countless times adapted them to their own struggles. Like all ballad singing, whether the song ends sadly or hopefully it serves the purpose of connecting many generations and helping the singer move through their own struggles. It’s an empowering and affirming tool that I hope continues for at least another thousand years.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://carmenmariamachado.com/">Carmen Maria Machado</a> writes rich, fabulist fiction that draws on fairy tales and folklore. She has some exciting publications forthcoming&#8211;including a debut short story collection, </em>Her Body &amp; Other Parties<em> (Graywolf Press), and a story in The Ochre Issue of </em><a href="http://fairytalereview.com/">Fairy Tale Review</a><em>. For this interview, however, I decided to ask Machado about an older story&#8211; <a href="http://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/">&#8220;The Husband Stitch,&#8221;</a> published by </em>Granta<em> in October 2014, and inspired by a frightening children&#8217;s tale, urban legends, and the experience of being an awkward kid at Girl Scout Camp.</em></p>
<p><b>&#8220;The Husband Stitch,&#8221; is a variation on &#8220;The Green Ribbon,&#8221; a popular scary story (I remember it well from childhood!). How did you first encounter &#8220;The Green Ribbon&#8221;? Why did you decide to write your own version of it? </b></p>
<p>I first read “The Green Ribbon” in Alvin Schwartz’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Dark,_Dark_Room_and_Other_Scary_Stories"><i>In a Dark, Dark Room and Other Scary Stories</i></a>, a children’s book in the vein of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scary_Stories_to_Tell_in_the_Dark"><i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i></a> series. (Though with significantly less terrifying illustrations.) Anyway, <i>In a Dark, Dark Room</i> had a story called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3PIkV2anqk">The Green Ribbon</a>,” by which I was simultaneously repulsed and entranced. Of all the urban legend and folktale retellings in Schwartz’s oeuvre, that’s the one that stuck with me the most.</p>
<p>Later, when I was in graduate school, I was hanging out with friends when <i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i> came up in conversation. That series pretty much scared everyone in my generation, and each person in my group had a different story from it that’d scared the bejeesus out of them as kids.</p>
<p>My brain kept returning to “The Green Ribbon,” and it occurred to me that there are all kinds of interesting currents about gender running beneath that story’s deceptively simple ice. That summer, I sat down and wrote the first draft of “<a href="http://granta.com/The-Husband-Stitch/">The Husband Stitch</a>.” At the time, it was just a straight re-telling of the protagonist’s story from meeting her future husband to her head falling off; the metafictional elements and retellings of other urban legends came later in the editing process.</p>
<p><span id="more-305"></span></p>
<p><b>Themes of transgressive female desire and secret female knowledge are central to &#8220;The Husband Stitch.&#8221; The story is based on a scary folk tale, and weaves in references to other frightening stories and fairy tales. What do you think it is about fairy tales, folk tales and scary stories that make them such great devices for exploring these themes? </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kate Bernheimer has a wonderful essay, “<a href="http://www.katebernheimer.com/images/Fairy%20Tale%20is%20Form.pdf">Fairy Tale is Form, Form is Fairy Tale</a>,” in which she praises the “artistic dexterity” of the fairy tale and discusses a critical part of the form: flatness. She writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 90px;">This absence of depth, this flatness, violates a technical rule writers are often taught in beginning writing classes: that a character’s psychological depth is crucial to a story. In a fairy tale, however, this flatness functions beautifully; it allows depth of response in the reader.</p>
<p>This syncs up very closely with my own experience: that an ostensibly flat fairy tale with minimalist, abstract prose permits a range of deep emotions in a capable reader. Plus, a writer adapting a fairy tale has infinite tools at her disposal; she can tweak some or all of the form’s elements, and perform any other number of techniques (modernization, reversal of point-of-view, blending with another story, etc.) into near-infinite variations. The fairy tale is simply an excellent foundation for its own interrogation.</p>
<p>But in addition to the flexibility of the flatness—and perhaps more importantly—there’s also the “fairy tale as mirror” factor. No one will deny that many fairy tales have their own demented, regressive logic and morality, particularly when it comes to issues of gender. Giambattista Basile&#8217;s “The Old Woman Who Was Skinned,” for example—the origin of my <i>Fairy Tale Review</i> story “<a href="http://fairytalereview.com/the-ochre-issue/">The Old Women Who Were Skinned</a>”—is about an old woman permitting herself to be literally skinned so that she might be beautiful as her fairy-transformed sister, with a “lesson” at the end about vanity. “<a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/frog.html#grimm1">The Frog King</a>” is deeply and uncritically rape-y. The Charles Perrault version of “<a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0312.html#perrault">Bluebeard</a>,” a story about abuse and femicide, has <i>two</i> terrible “morals”—</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><b>Moral:</b> Curiosity, in spite of its appeal, often leads to deep regret. To the displeasure of many a maiden, its enjoyment is short lived. Once satisfied, it ceases to exist, and always costs dearly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><b>Another moral:</b> Apply logic to this grim story, and you will ascertain that it took place many years ago. No husband of our age would be so terrible as to demand the impossible of his wife, nor would he be such a jealous malcontent. For, whatever the color of her husband&#8217;s beard, the wife of today will let him know who the master is.</p>
<p>—neither of which properly gets at the heart of the story’s true horror. In fact, they almost appear to deliberately, laughably miss the story’s monstrosity.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that these morals serve as powerful mirrors for women’s actual relationships with the world: how we are steeped in a culture of rape and violence and death; how, if we resist, we are punished; how, even if we punish ourselves, we are mocked and blamed. And these mirrors are not (just) historical, not vague and old-timey and how it used to be. They are mirrors of here, now, today.</p>
<p>The fairy tale usually plays this element straight, of course, but that makes them virtual playgrounds for feminist writers; all we have to do is pick a story up and turn it askance.</p>
<p><b>The motif of the green ribbon, coupled with the themes of transgressive desire and secret knowledge, reminded me of Angela Carter&#8217;s short story &#8220;The Bloody Chamber&#8221; (a variation on Bluebeard in which the protagonist is gifted a red ribbon by her betrothed—a ribbon that prefigures the way he wants to kill her). Are you familiar with this story? Has Angela Carter inspired your work? What other writers and storytellers have influenced you?</b></p>
<p>Ah, yes. “A choker of rubies, two inches wide, like an extraordinarily precious slit throat… the flashing crimson jewels… bright as arterial blood.” That image is so vivid and terrible and beautiful. I do love Angela Carter’s work very much, but I came to her a bit later that one might expect. My literary education was sort of fragmented and weird; it was almost entirely self-directed (neither of my parents were big readers; I didn’t major in literature in college) and thus contained large gaps that I’ve only recently amended.</p>
<p>For example, I once wrote a story that an entire workshop identified as heavily influenced by Shirley Jackson. At first, I was confused by this comment, because I hadn’t read a stitch of Shirley Jackson beyond “The Lottery” in high school. But what I later concluded was that I’d read a lot of writers who were influenced by Shirley Jackson; so I was getting her fragmented, filtered influence.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I have read and am obsessed with Angela Carter and Shirley Jackson both. Other writers who influence my work: Patricia Highsmith, Jane Bowles, Muriel Sparks, Kelly Link, Karen Russell, Yoko Ogawa, Kazuo Ishiguro, Gloria Naylor, Gabriel García Márquez, Nicholson Baker, Kevin Brockmeier, Michelle Huneven, Michel Faber, Joyce Carol Oates, Helen Oyeyemi, Ann Patchett, Virginia Woolf, Jeanette Winterson, Sarah Waters, Michael Chabon, Alissa Nutting, Andrea Barrett, Chris Adrian, Ray Bradbury… I could go on forever.</p>
<p><b>“The Husband Stitch” is peppered with instructions that tell the reader how to share the story out loud, should they want to do so. These instructions gesture at traditions of oral storytelling. Why did you decide to include these instructions? What do you think they bring to &#8220;The Husband Stitch&#8221;? </b></p>
<p>When I was a Girl Scout, we’d go on this annual autumn camping trip in the Pocono Mountains. I sort of loved and hated it—I hated how cold and dark it was. I hated bugs. I hated the latrine. But I was enamored with the campfire—telling stories around it, eating food cooked in it, throwing various objects into it to see how they burned. (My favorite: a half-filled Dixie cup, which immediately burned down to the water line. Then the wax on the exterior blistered, and the contents bubbled and boiled for what seemed like forever, burned off, and then the entire thing was consumed by the flames.)</p>
<p>I was a really weird kid, and didn’t get along with the girls my age. But I was a good storyteller—theatrical, dramatic, effusive—and I loved telling tales around the campfire. So the first time I read the <i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i> series—which included a story where a ghost’s question, “Who’s got my money? Whoooo? Whoooo?” is followed by instructions for the storyteller to grab someone and yell “YOU’VE GOT IT!”—I became obsessed with the idea of the story crossing over into the real world. Which I did, the next chance I got. It was exactly as fun and exciting as I’d imagined. (And, bonus, I got to make a fellow Girl Scout cry. An artist is born!)</p>
<p>So of course, as I was working on “The Husband Stitch,” I got the idea to fold in warped narrative instructions. It does all kinds of interesting work: breaks down the wall between the story and the reader, invokes a tradition of oral storytelling, reinforces the story’s danger as real and literal, enables further commentary on gender, and is also just plain fun.</p>
<p>After I published “The Husband Stitch,” I received a bit of fan mail in which the writer told me that they had read this passage:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;">(If you are reading this story out loud, move aside the curtain to illustrate this final point to your listeners. It’ll be raining, I promise.)</p>
<p>And then felt compelled to push aside their living room curtain. And it was raining. And it blew their mind. Knowing that has happened <i>even once</i> fills me with incomprehensible amounts of joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;White as Snow&#8221; is a piece of book art that navigates the difficult ideological transition towards adulthood. The period of child development known as &#8216;foreclosure&#8217; describes the refusal to enter the experimental phase most often associated with adolescence, in which the child tries out different experiences &#8212; often rebellious &#8212; as a fundamental part of forming their personality. A child who forecloses this period of freedom is unwilling to step outside their knowledge of themselves; instead choosing to remain frozen in one incarnation.</p>
<p>This work implements the &#8216;classic&#8217; version of the Snow White story as a metaphor for foreclosure, as well as hinting at the consequences involved in maintaining purity and goodness (as defined in the fairytale genre itself). In the narrative, the active and cunning Queen is seen as transgressive and is punished, while the passive and personality-deficient Snow White is lauded as the &#8216;good&#8217; character; a model for children to emulate. To step outside the rigid and restricted definition of what amounts to a positive female role model is to be irrevocably tainted as &#8216;bad.&#8217; Anne Sexton&#8217;s poem on the subject depicts Snow White as a fragile china doll rolling her eyes open and shut, ever virginal, ever trapped within the limits of her self-imposed and immmobilising purity. The drawings animate as the pages are flipped, revealing a young girl (the model used was twelve) trapped under ice which slowly thaws, allowing her to blink at the viewer much like in the poem. However, the ice never fully melts and eventually freezes over once more, trapping the girl in the limits of her internalised self-restraint. In this way the character is &#8216;good&#8217; only due to the lack of what is &#8216;bad;&#8217; defined more by absence than presence.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following is an excerpt from &#8220;Baba Yaga Burns Paris to the Ground,&#8221; which can be read in full at <a href="http://www.tangledwilderness.org/baba-yaga-burns-paris-to-the-ground/#more-1119">Strangers in a Tangled Wilderness</a>.</em></p>
<p>In Russian stories, Baba Yaga is tougher on Russians than anyone else, and she lusts particularly for Russian blood. It’s suggested that she’s testing her fellow Russians, ensuring that they respect and deserve to live on Russian soil. The industrial revolution and three-thousand odd miles stand between Baba Yaga and the pétroleuses; they belong to different worlds. Still, I see similarities between Baba Yaga’s defense of Russia’s forests and the incendiaries’ defense of their sprawling city.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/babacover-full.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-164" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/babacover-full.jpg" alt="babacover-full" width="825" height="510" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/babacover-full.jpg 825w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/babacover-full-300x185.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" /></a></p>
<p>Baba Yaga has an array of magical objects: her house on chicken legs, her mortar and pestle ship, her one leg made of bone. All of these give her power and bring the stories that she stars in to life on the page. But what interests me most is Baba Yaga’s associations with fire. Her house is sometimes located across a river of flame and is ringed by lanterns made of human skulls. Her stove is her greatest threat, a place where characters believe they will be incinerated, although it as often resurrects life. Like Fitz Fitcher, Baba Yaga has the power to take life, but like the youngest sister, she can also put it back together again. Baba Yaga can even resurrect herself: in fact, she sometimes dies at the end of a story, only to turn up in yet another tale.</p>
<p>Baba Yaga is neither fairy godmother nor evil sorceress. She is something more ambiguous. She teaches those who come to her door essential survival skills. She teaches them when to be honest or to lie, when to obey or demand, to steal or stay. Baba Yaga doles out punishment, but she also doles out tough love. Why, then, the bad reputation? Perhaps she is called evil to remind the young that she is opposed to the Christian order of things, that she cares not for polite society. That even if she helps the hero, she is a wild woman and not to be trusted. If Baba Yaga builds incendiary devices to give to little girls, and Baba Yaga is good, doesn’t that mean the social order is at least a little bad?</p>

				<description><![CDATA[by Wren Awry “In ‘Bluebeard&#8217;, as in cinematic horror,” Maria Tatar writes, “We have not only a killer that is propelled by cinematic rage, but also the abject victims of his serial murders, as well as a ‘final girl’ who either saves herself or arranges her own rescue.”[1] You can find this “final girl” trope &#8230; <a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/2015/06/the-not-so-final-girl/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">The Not-So-Final Girl</span></a>]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by Wren Awry</em></p>
<p>“In ‘Bluebeard&#8217;, as in cinematic horror,” Maria Tatar writes, “We have not only a killer that is propelled by cinematic rage, but also the abject victims of his serial murders, as well as a ‘final girl’ who either saves herself or arranges her own rescue.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> You can find this “final girl” trope in film noir classics and tacky slasher films alike; it is a staple of the horror genre.</p>
<p>Ana Lily Amirpour’s <em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</em> is different. Instead of being a final girl, Amirpour’s punkish protagonist (called, simply, The Girl), is a vampire who doles out vigilante justice to bad men. She is, in a way, an anti-Bluebeard.</p>
<p>The Girl stalks the streets of Bad City, a sparse Iranian ghost town made up of a handful of residents, an abandoned power plant, and a ravine where dead bodies are thrown. The town’s powerful pimp, Saeed, is The Girl’s first on-screen victim: she watches Saeed cheat and assault sex worker Atti. When Saeed invites The Girl to his home and attempts to seduce her, she kills him.</p>
<p>The Girl’s other victims are also men that mistreat Atti, including heroin addict Hossein, who forces Atti to shoot up with him. The Girl—watching through the eyes of her avatar, a cat—enters Atti’s bedroom and kills Hossein. While Bluebeard lures young girls in to his home, the Girl trespasses into forbidden chambers—Saeed’s gated house, Hossein’s heroin-infused dream world—to do away with them.</p>
<p>The Girl doesn’t just kill, she also warns. She asks a little boy, skateboarding alone at night, if he is good. When he answers, “Yes,” she calls him a liar. Threatens him. Tells him she will be watching him. <em>Don’t grow up to be a shitty dude</em>, The Girl seems to be saying, <em>And I won’t have to drink your blood.</em></p>
<p>There’s one good boy in the film, and she let’s him live. He’s Arash, Hossein’s son and The Girl’s brooding, dutiful, leather-jacketed love interest. He’s a sort of “final boy,” but he, too, mixes up what’s expected of him. At the end of the film, after Arash realizes that the Girl murdered his father and that she could easily murder him, he skips town with her anyway.</p>
<p>“A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night” isn’t riffing on “Bluebeard” directly. But it’s playing with the tropes of horror films, and by subverting cinematic horror, the film turns “Bluebeard” on its head in profound and chilling ways.</p>
