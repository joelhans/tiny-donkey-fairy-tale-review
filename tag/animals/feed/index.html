								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Growing up, you were shy. Or maybe you were short, you were fat, you had bad teeth. You had frizzy hair, you wet the bed, you spoke with a stammer. You slept with a stuffed toy ‘til you were twelve, or ‘til you were twenty, or ‘til your monthly blood ran out and you began soaking the bed with night sweats and hot flashes and Mississippi-wide rivers of regrets. You’re almost an old woman now. Love and transcendence have passed you by. Those fairy tales you were fed by Hollywood and MTV and Hans Christian Andersen as a child, and the ones you fed yourself to get by, through the loneliness of the school playground, through the long tick-tocking overthinking of the night, through the daily treacheries of life – they all lied.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-840" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed.jpg" alt="" width="735" height="651" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed.jpg 735w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed-300x266.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which fairy tale was it you always went back to, the one you believed in most? The one with the song saying someday your prince would come? Or the one where the funny-looking little duckling (you don’t like to say “ugly” – it’s a word that’s been used against you so many times) turns into a stunner of a swan? Did you think that might be you one day? Did you really? All along, you should have paid more attention to the crone, the ogre, the unredeemed outcasts, the ones haunting the margins, or worse yet, the ordinary ones, the unmagical, the unnamed and underappreciated. Because these were your destiny – not the beautiful ones, not the princess and the swan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or maybe the fairy tales didn’t lie. You just saw in them what you wanted, took what you needed. Beauty, hope, promises of happily ever after, some danger to make things interesting, some fear to cut through the dull of the everyday. You simply ignored the despair. Even though all fairy tales, and all life, is rife with it. Like that moment in <a href="http://hca.gilead.org.il/ugly_duc.html">Andersen’s tale about the duckling</a>, when the bullied little bird welcomes the beauty of spring and a bevy of swans with pure, piercing heartache:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">“I will fly to those royal birds,” he exclaimed, “and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter…”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">Then he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans. The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">“Kill me,” said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the next moment the duckling sees his reflection in the water, sees a swan looking back – his transformed self, his true tribe, his happily ever after. I wonder though, if the duckling had seen no change, no beauty, no swan staring back at him in the water, could he still have survived? Would he still have come to know happiness, belonging, self-love?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I need to know, same as every once and for-all-time misfit. Is there magic after all in despair? Can there be beauty in forsaken hope, transcendence without transformation, belonging when you’re the only one around to hear your own questions, a happy ending when the fairy tale, or life, or maybe yourself, is found so wanting?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Think back on the ones you paid too little attention to, while you were paying as little attention to the beauty in your worst and best self. The crone, the ogre, the marginal, the ordinary. The untransformed duckling. The resilient, the persisting, the interesting and astute, the ultimately self-accepting and wise. Lucky you – these were your destiny. The unbeautiful ones, who know how to make magic out of the most disappointing circumstances, to potion up an unbreakable spell of endurance out of yesterday’s cold pot of despair. Let them teach you to love whatever reflection stares back at you, to see the beauty in even a fantastically imperfect you.</p>
