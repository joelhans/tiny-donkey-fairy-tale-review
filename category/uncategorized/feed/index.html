								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In the two and a half years that I’ve been editing <em>Tiny Donkey</em>, I’ve never written about my favorite fairy tale. It’s a lesser known story from the Brothers Grimm (although, as fairy tale enthusiasts, you probably know it!) called <a href="http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/bluebeard/stories/fitchersbird.html">“Fitcher’s Bird,”</a> about a young heroine who outwits an evil sorcerer and saves her sisters in the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One thing I love about “Fitcher’s Bird”&#8211;something that <a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/2016/10/interview-pauline-greenhill/">Pauline Greenhill</a> writes about in <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/247490">“Fitcher’s [Queer] Bird: A Fairy-Tale Heroine and Her Avatars”</a>&#8211;is that the story doesn’t have a Disney-perfect ending. The heroine doesn’t marry a prince, inherit a kingdom, or even return to a simple-but-cozy cottage to live out the rest of her days. Instead, as Greenhill writes, “There is no happily-ever-after in ‘Fitcher’s Bird,’ the tale ends with the death of [femicidal sorcerer] Fitcher and his cronies. [Heroine] Fitcher’s Bird is last seen on the path from Fitcher’s house, speaking to the sorcerer, again a truly liminal location.” There’s something freeing about this ending and it’s refusal to be tied up in a happily-ever-after bow&#8211;something that allows for multiple possibilities and paths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we started <em>Tiny Donkey</em> in April 2015, it felt like we were beginning from that unknown place in the woods. With the blessing of <em>Fairy Tale Review’s</em> founding editor Kate Bernheimer and the help of then-prose editor Joel Hans, we started this journal with the question, “What is fairy-tale nonfiction?” Over the next two and a half years, we published fairy-tale-esque memoir, cultural criticism, academic analyses, and experimental prose in attempts to find answers. We accompanied this work with interviews of our favorite fairy-tale writers and thinkers, from <a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/2016/02/interview-carmen-maria-machado/">Carmen Maria Machado</a> to <a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/2016/05/interview-aaron-mahnke/">Aaron Mahnke</a> to <a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/2017/02/interview-kate-bernheimer/">Kate Bernheimer</a> herself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We still don’t have an answer to our query, but we have lots of ideas of what fairy-tale nonfiction can be. In so many ways, we’re still in the middle of that enchanted forest&#8211;except, instead of just a few of us editors, these woods are now crowded with our contributors and readers, our supporters and interviewees. It’s nice here&#8211;overgrown and full of chirping birds, scurrying animals, and unknown prospects and potentials.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And this, dear reader, is where we’ll leave you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re ending <em>Tiny Donkey</em> for one of those usual reasons: not enough capacity. Over the past few years we’ve all grown and changed as writers, editors, and humans, and other projects have started consuming our time and energy. For example:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Former editor Richard Leis continues to read, write, and submit poetry and fiction, and participates in workshops at the Writers Studio Tucson and the University of Arizona Poetry Center. Leis recently won the Writers Studio’s Write-to-Read award and read his poem <a href="https://richardleis.com/2017/10/23/appearance-wrap-up-room-a-literary-reading-at-antigone-books/">“These Are the Animals You May Eat”</a> at Tucson’s Antigone Books.</li>
<li>Editor Anna Lea Jancewicz’s short story collection <em>(m)otherhood</em> is forthcoming this autumn from Widow and Orphan House Press, and she continues her work as Editor-in-Chief of <em><a href="https://rabblelit.com/">Rabble Lit</a></em>, a journal of working class literature that you should definitely check out, if you haven’t already.</li>
<li>Editor René Ostberg has been writing but experiencing a year of full rejection.  On the plus side, she recently moved and now lives across the street from a river with a railroad tracks close by. She enjoys watching the river rise and recede from week to week and listening to the traffic and trains roll by at night – it brings comfort and perspective in distressing times. She might self-publish something called <em>Heartlandic</em> by year’s end – check in on her at <a href="https://reneostberg.com/">her website</a> for updates if you like.</li>
<li>Editorial assistant Gabriel A. Jiménez is at work on a collection of short stories, and will soon be applying to graduate programs. His long-term goal is to become a literature professor.</li>
<li>Editorial assistant Cat Solewin is editing a local author&#8217;s memoir manuscript and is an editor at <em>Rain Shadow Review</em>, an annual anthology of writing from current and formerly incarcerated writers put together by Richard Shelton and Erec Toso. Cat will be graduating from the University of Arizona in Fall 2018 and applying to Creative Writing MFA programs to further develop her fiction writing.</li>
<li>In July, I began working at the University of Arizona Poetry Center as the Education Programs Assistant, a job that enables me to combine my interests in social justice, education, and creative writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Tiny Donkey</em> archive and the work it contains will remain online for future readers. We are indebted to all the writers and interviewees who contributed to this project and to<em> Fairy Tale Review’s</em> Kate Bernheimer, Joel Hans, and Jon Riccio, who so graciously made space for this journal in the world.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The media is awash with think pieces on anarchism. What a time to be alive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Honestly, I hadn’t thought that within my lifetime I would see <em>black bloc</em> or <em>Antifa</em> become household words. But following the Inauguration Day protests in D.C., and in the aftermath of the white supremacist assaults and terrorist attack in Charlottesville, these terms are on the tongues of, or are at least being googled by, average Americans who never before have cracked the spines of a Bakunin volume, or even considered that <em>anarchy</em> has a meaning beyond its being maligned as a synonym for <em>chaos</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The hot takes on the ethics of violence, and the vivisections of community defense strategies are riveting, the kind of sexy that scores the clicks. What’s missing from the conversation is an examination of what the overwhelming bulk of anarchist theory really looks like in practice. The vast majority of everyday anarchists have never slung a Molotov cocktail, and are far, far more likely to regularly wield a soup ladle as their weapon of choice. Your garden-variety anarchist is probably digging in your local community garden as we speak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my experience, most of what anarchists do is feed people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, one of the most elegant illustrations of anarchism is to be found in a pithy folk tale, old and widely known, about a collective feast that burgeons from nothing but a rock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stop me if you think you’ve heard this one before.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two strangers come tramping into town. They are wretched and lumpen, and they are hungry. They ask the town-folk for something to calm their gnawing bellies, but are turned away, told at each house that there is nothing to spare.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps some of the householders turn them away because they cringe at the color of the skin the travelers wear, or because the lilt of their mother tongue sounds hateful to their ears. Perhaps some fervently claim that no human deserves food without first having earned it through the selling of their labor or the proving of their virtue. Maybe even most of the neighbors truly believe that they just haven’t got enough to share.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So the hungry two wander to the river, and at least slake their thirst. One of them pulls a soup pot from their satchel and builds a fire. They fill the pot with water and drop in a stone from the riverbed. Before long, there is a pleasant aroma. The strangers begin to laugh, they sing a little. A curious villager approaches, and then another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>We are making this fine soup,</em> they say. <em>If only we had just a sprig of herb to help the flavor.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>If only one among you had just a stump of a carrot.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>…just a scrap of potato, just a splash of oil, just a sliver of garlic…</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>a few beans</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>a golden onion</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Soon, there is a lively crowd of villagers eager to make their small contributions to the bubbling pot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everybody eats.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then perhaps somebody brings out their drum, another produces a fiddle. Perhaps there is dancing in rings and telling of stories and nursing of babies and braiding of hair. Maybe one neighbor fetches their hammer to fix another’s wagon. Maybe some older folks teach the children the names of the trees and fungi and wildflowers that grow along the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anarchism is non-hierarchical, non-coercive community organization for mutual aid and benefit. People, as equals, voluntarily sharing and helping and loving their neighbors so that every individual is cared for and the collective thrives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It may sound like a fairy tale, but it’s happening right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In hundreds of autonomous chapters across the country, anarchists in <a href="http://www.foodnotbombs.net/new_site/">Food Not Bombs</a> have been, for thirty-five years, collecting otherwise wasted food from individuals, businesses, and even dumpsters to create free meals for the hungry in their communities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They make a lot of stone soup, but that’s only the beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://freegan.info/what-is-a-freegan/freegan-practices/guerilla-gardening/">Community gardens</a>, <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/41803-antifa-and-leftists-organize-mutual-aid-and-rescue-networks-in-houston">medic collectives</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedNews/videos/1615288255158853/">Harm Reduction projects</a>, <a href="https://www.shareable.net/blog/how-to-start-a-really-really-free-market">Really Really Free Markets</a>, <a href="https://www.iww.org/content/about-iww">organizing workers</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/PortlandAnarchistRoadCare/about/">outlaw road repair</a>, <a href="https://www.theclio.com/web/entry?id=9908">rogue traffic patrols</a>, <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/organizing-prisoner-class-interview-iwoc/">prisoners’ advocacy</a>, <a href="https://libcom.org/library/tenants-union-fight-your-landlord-win">tenants’ unions</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of these things are anarchy in action.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefigurative_politics">Prefigurative politics</a></em> is often described as “building the new world in the shell of the old.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our new world has already begun, birthed from a stone in a pot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>We are making this fine soup we say.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>If only we had just a sprig of herb to help the flavor&#8230;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Vox Urbana is a seven-piece bi-national band from Tucson, Arizona that infuses Latin sounds with elements of rock. The band breaks language barriers and stereotypes through their repertoire and distinct grooves, and includes a guitar, keyboard, sax, trombone, bass guitar, congas, and drums played by a diverse roster of musicians. Vox Urbana is a small ensemble of incredible talent who aim to expand their musical horizons and share the stories of others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The band uses a style of folk music known as corridos to compose songs about the border community. A corrido is a story told in song. The word comes from the Spanish verb “correr,” which means to run, and indicates there will be a running narrative. Corridos are often about oppression, history, and the daily life struggle of those less fortunate. The band has been working on a project called <em>Cumbia Corridos</em>, a musical story-sharing project that tells the stories of immigrants crossing the border and Tucson’s marginalized denizens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I spoke with Saul Millan, the band’s trombonist, who joined the band about four years ago when he bumped into Enrique “Kiki” Castellanos, the band’s co-founder and guitarist, at a supermarket. This chance meeting catapulted Saul onto an extraordinary journey of personal growth and experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Cumbia Corridos project has helped immigrants tell their stories of struggles and overcoming challenges. How has the project influenced the band’s approach to music, as well as your personal lives?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the band, this project definitely helped shape the understanding that our music can be a powerful tool. It influences us to write music that carries a message and theme, emulating corridos&#8211;the classic Mexican-style of songwriting that includes writing a story. This was the first time I wrote on a concept album and the testimonies redirected my approach on how I composed music.</p>
<p><span id="more-886"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How did you guys choose which testimonies to convert into songs?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We choose the testimonies from people who have migrated to the U.S. from Central America and Mexico. We mostly wrote about the experience of women and non-male individuals. It is important for us to tell the stories of migration of of women, children, and the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Are the lyrics of your song, “Cuentan los Cerros,” about the brutal journey the immigrants face going north of the border?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, the lyrics talk about the experience of crossing north of the border to reunite with a loved one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What was the process like for writing your latest release,<em> La Pitaya</em>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was our attempt to further use our vocals to send a message and probe at deeper meanings in testimonies through our music. “La Piedra y La Bala” is about a young boy, Jose Antonio Elena, in Nogales who allegedly threw a rock at and was murdered by a Border Patrol agent. His case has gotten national recognition and it seemed as a story we had to talk about. We definitely had a lot to work from. This album serves as a stepping stone to our current music which carries universal themes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Is there a song from the band’s catalogue that gets a huge response from a live crowd?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Pepe Arpia” is our most requested song from a live crowd. It’s a song that condemns [former] Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s actions and brutality against minorities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vox Urbana has been described as a cumbia band that fuses its sound with elements of punk and even psychedelic rock. There are also elements of salsa, mambo, and huapango. Do you believe this fully captures the band’s musical style and goals?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I think that those things are completely true but more than anything the musical style of the group mostly focuses on other people’s experiences. Each band member is from a different time period associated with a different musical style and background. The diversity in the group is amazing. We have our bass player that is from the Netherlands. Kiki and I are from the border town–Nogales–and the rest of the members are from different cities across the country. It makes things interesting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What has been the band’s most significant or cherished moment?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can only speak from a personal stance. My most cherished moment is when we played at El Casino Ballroom and did the release for the <em>Cumbia Corridos</em> project. It brought a lot of people together. People who had painful testimonies to share and we helped them find a voice. It also helped them forget, even for just a moment, about their struggles and they just danced the night away. It was powerful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Is the band currently working on new material? If so, can we get details on the group’s future plans?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are currently working on the <em>Cumbia Corridos</em> concept album. We are just finishing on the details of this album, but we want to make sure we get it right for all of those who shared their stories with us. Our main focus is to promote this album in order for these testimonies to be heard.</p>

<p><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/unnamed.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-876" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/unnamed-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="428" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/unnamed-200x300.jpg 200w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/unnamed.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></a>The best college course I’ve taken thus far is Fairy Tales as Literature with esteemed fairy tale scholar and part-time fairy godmother, Dr. Christine Butterworth-McDermott. Halfway through covering the classics, a classmate remarked that they felt disillusioned by the tales. This shocked me. Were they really expecting Cinderella’s stepsisters to go unpunished, or Oscar Wilde’s Selfish Giant to live forever, or bread crumb trails to not get eaten by birds? Had they never heard of a jealous stepmother decapitating her child via chest lid à la “The Juniper Tree”?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a millennial, I’ve seen my peers expect fairy tale figures to fall in real love the first go-around, sans magical spells, and Neighbors Wolves to give Little Reds a break. There’s a naive desire for rabbit holes like carnival rides, to get out when it&#8217;s not fun anymore. As young people, we’ve waded for too long in the pool of Disney where everything is lovely and resolves itself. Now, sitting in a classroom being asked to engage with “The Juniper Tree” or Perrault’s “Cinderella,” it feels like a veil has been torn.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The idea embedded in “happily ever after”&#8211;that life is changed for the better in a split second, void of consequence or reality&#8211;is one that should be laughed off the stage. But when presented with it dressed like an old lady offering to tighten the corset laces of a hidden princess, there’s shock when the princess is left to flounder on the cottage floor, suffocating. Well, Bluebeard looks like the husband type, forget all those missing wives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maybe that’s why there’s an ambient sadness when Hansel and Gretel are abandoned by their parents, or Donkeyskin’s father pursues her so. It’s too close to home. Having gone to the pages to find a happy family, friendly creatures, and a predictable trajectory to follow, there can be a bitter feeling of having been tricked out of a good time. To me, that’s all the more reason to dig both heels in and reside in fairy tale literature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Generations have walked through the forest before, lantern-less and trusting. Millennials: I’m convinced we’re more fortunate than we realize. With fairytales as our guide, we can make it through, too.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[Content warning: This essay mentions sexual assault.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The protagonist’s motivation in “East of the Sun, West of the Moon” has taunted me since childhood and needled my writing. To my feminist mother’s delight, by age three I was pointing out sexism on what little TV I was allowed to watch. We lived in Maryland with my Norwegian grandfather, in whose kitchen hung a witch to ward off evil. At Christmas, tiny elf decorations called <em>julenissen</em> abounded. With a heart for magic and an eye for criticism, I read Scandinavian fairy tales, and “East of the Sun, West of the Moon” drew both my wonder and scorn.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/weast_nielsen1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-849 alignright" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/weast_nielsen1.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="546" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/weast_nielsen1.jpg 357w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/weast_nielsen1-179x300.jpg 179w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></a>In the fairy tale, a peasant gives his youngest daughter to a polar bear in exchange for gold. The polar bear takes her to his castle and forbids that she speak to her mother alone. The bear is secretly a prince cursed by the troll queen. He only resumes his human form in darkness when he sleeps with the girl. She endures this until she visits home and, “disobeying” him, confides in her mother, who gives her a candle. One night while the man is asleep, the girl lights the candle and accidentally wakes him. The troll queen whisks him away to marry her daughter. How sad that our heroine has lost her handsome, royal rapist! She must go rescue him—and suffer constant victim blaming along the way—finally winning him back with her ability to clean his shirt. Whoo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I loved the idea of traipsing through the frozen north with someone to protect me, and would later discover what a maternal archetype bears are with origins in Paleolithic bear worship. Mother bears emerging from hibernation with their cubs made bears symbols of rebirth and fertility. The “great she-bear” constellation Ursa Major has a storied past that existed long before its Greco-Roman myth. And then there is Artio, fierce protector and ultimate mama bear Celtic goddess, whose influence trickled down to my own Irish surname (McMahon means “son of the bear”). While the fairy tale evoked a Jungian response in me, I didn’t understand why the prince’s disappearance was the girl’s fault, or why she wanted him back. Stockholm syndrome was not something I knew of yet, and I remain unconvinced that wealth was her motivation. So what changed? What drove her to face death—via troll predation—to rescue her captor?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While this depends on the retelling, at an essential level, these questions spur my fiction. I write to understand people. What causes characters to act in ways that surprise themselves and even the reader? And how is this made believable?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer to both is rich character development made possible by feminism. To craft fully realized characters of any gender is a feminist act. This doesn’t mean the characters proceed as feminists. But giving them the <em>capacity</em> for the breadth of human emotion and behavior undercuts traditional forms of gender and thus creates compelling, multi-dimensional actors. And as a reader or writer, it only makes the story more satisfying when I don’t simply face the trolls, but <em>demand</em> to, prince or no prince.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Leland Heathco, Joseph Bell (who could not be reached for an interview), and Brian Maddock co-authored a piece titled “Legacy in Red” which appeared in the 2014 edition of the </em>Rain Shadow Review<em>, an annual publication that consists of work by current or formerly incarcerated writers (you can read the story at the bottom of this post). I was struck by the powerfully executed reimagining of “Little Red Riding Hood,&#8221; in which the reader sees the concepts of power and gender reversed from the original. The red cape no longer represents a weak and startlingly naïve young girl, but instead a line of powerful women whose roles are complex and nuanced. In the same way that their characters consist of layers not previously attributed to them, interviewing these men helped me see past my preconceived notions and afforded me a richer, deeper view of a world that I had previously looked at with a certain shallowness. I encourage you to please look at the information provided after the interview about various prison writing programs and ways to become involved.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Brian Maddock is a 49 year-old kid-at-heart who graduated from AZ State University with a Bachelor’s in Computer Information Systems. He has worked in large IT departments developing and fixing software to help businesses operate. He enjoys hiking in the woods, swimming, reading fantastical stories, and public speaking. He has published poetry, essays, and children’s stories while incarcerated and would like to explore the medium of flash fiction. Brian gets a kick out of teaching beginning Spanish, computer basics, and essay writing, but enjoys learning equally well. He is an Arizona native and would love to eventually reside near the Pacific coast.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Leland Heathco was born on May 5th, 1957. He was raised in southern Alabama on the east coast of Mobile Bay, in a small farming community called Barnwell. Because of his father’s work as a pipe-fitter, the family traveled, which provided a cultural awakening for him as a young boy and gave him an early opportunity to learn about cultural diversity. Leland learned about working hard side-by-side with migrant workers on the farms. After dropping out of school in the eighth grade, his first job was working on a copper smelter down in the Playas Valley, not far from Animas, New Mexico. In May of 1975, he joined the Army for four years. He has been married twice and has four sons. Leland suffers from chronic free-spiritedness, and been to 27 states, including Hawaii. He also traveled to the Philippines, Germany, and the Isle of Crete, and firmly believes that travel is good for storytelling.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I understand that the piece was put together collaboratively between the three authors with no agreed upon theme or prevalent story line. Why do you think the story ended up as a reimagining of &#8220;Little Red Riding Hood&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BM:</strong> This story began as nothing more than a blank notepad passed among three aspiring writers, each producing one line and passing it to the next as an exercise. The first line spoke of a hunter’s moon in a forest; the next author chose to add an owl on a branch. Ultimately, the word “wolf” led to a line of thought centered on the “Little Red Riding Hood” fairy tale. From there, the “red cape” developed into a symbol for a strong line of heroines, and soon the coalesced fantasy/fairy tale emerged from the amorphous lines we all contributed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LH:</strong> The collaboration started the same way that most of my writing does. A word or a line comes to me that seems to stand out, begging for my attention, so I write it down. I’ve often thought that what I write already exists, and I’ve been fortunate that the words were given to me to write. I respect Brian and Joe as writers, and I don’t think this piece would have turned out the way it did without them. I was curious as to what might emerge if writers with different styles were to write together using a single sentence and no outline or story idea. The collaboration is the reason for the “Riding Hood” theme, which really materialized when the wolves were introduced. But, I did not want to write about Ms. Hood in the same way that she’s been depicted before. She brought herself into the story, but with a little help from me and my “Brothers of the Pen.&#8221; She is not a child, but a young woman coming of age, and coming to terms with a responsibility she does not want, however, there is honor and strength in her bloodline that will not allow her to back down from what’s before her. She is a thinker and a bad ass.</p>
<p><span id="more-826"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How did this story, focusing on strong, non-sexualized heroines, evolve in the confines of the hyper-masculine culture in prison?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BM:</strong> Certain inmates certainly fit a classic stereotype; tattooed, self-centered thieves and drug users. Many more do not. Some of us are creative, decent, humble people who led “normal”, law-abiding lives and sorely rue the day they made a bad decision and landed here. As such, the three of us respect women and feel that gender-equality should be a given in today’s world. We find it refreshing and appealing to see women in powerful roles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LH:</strong> Writing is a means of escape. If you’re surrounded by something all the time, you want to go as far away from that as possible. It’s too easy to write about macho culture because it’s so familiar. In writing about women, there’s the challenge of writing outside of a familiar mindset, and an escape to something opposite of what you are surrounded by daily. For me, it is a way to distance myself from my surroundings, which are super-masculine (or at least they try to create the illusion of masculinity). I’ve lived 60 years and I’ve known some strong women. I’ve been blessed to be loved by two. My appreciation of the beauty in life was taught to me by these women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The generational line of women in the story showcase women’s strength. They don’t run from the forest, they don’t view the wolves as bad or are scared of them, in fact they look out for them. Women are more than I have knowledge to speak about. What I do know, I try to write into my stories. “Red” is not a woman to follow a man, nor be a mild-mannered companion. She would be an equal partner and a friend.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Do you think the environment you faced in prison had any particular influence on the piece, as far as characters, themes, etc.?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BM:</strong> I believe our lack of physical freedom led to an open forest for the physical setting of the piece, rather than a cramped apartment or crowded city! Perhaps the “old crone” came to life by witnessing how older inmates experiencing long incarcerations tend to be respected and influence behavior of other men.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LH:</strong> I never really thought it, but I suppose that is a possibility. The similarities between this place and the woods are certainly something to think about. Prison can be a dark place, so that had an influence in the setting of the woods, with this darkness being a backdrop. There are parallels between the men and wolves as well. There is the illusion of aggression, with men posturing and seeming to act aggressive as a defense mechanism. The wolves act the same way – they appear to be aggressive creatures, but aren’t in actuality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Did you pursue creative writing endeavors before attending the workshops ran by Shelton and Toso?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BM:</strong> I’d always enjoyed reading Isaac Asimov, Terry Goodkind, David Eddings, and other fantasy/sci-fi authors, but I never pursued creative writing until I signed up for the workshop on a whim at the Tucson complex of the Arizona State Prison system. I wrote software in information technology departments for huge corporations most of my life, and my writing was always technical until I began writing in prison.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LH:</strong> I started writing late in life, and I actually spent the first six months watching and listening to others in the workshops before I wrote anything, but I’ve been writing now for about 8 years. However, I have been an avid reader most of my life. My first adult book was <em>A Girl Named Tamiko</em>. I found it in a box of my father’s books when I was 7 or 8. My father was a writer, but I don’t believe he was ever published. My love of reading and writing came from my father. I told him that I would keep writing, so that someday, perhaps, our last name would be seen in a good way. I wrote a poem and a short story for him just before he passed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What does the opportunity to write creatively mean to you, personally?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BM:</strong> Creative writing acts as a mentor that prompts me to stop immersing myself in the daily grind of infinite tedium. It moves me to look at the cascade of stars above, consider a world of artificially enhanced human lifespans, or the power of a selfless, precocious child influencing a town of curmudgeons. Writing reminds me to explore, grow, and enjoy!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LH:</strong> You can be yourself while writing. It’s a way to take away the mask of anger and to let other emotions comes through. It’s an escape from the anger and from your environment. Writing is also therapy, because if you get something down on paper it doesn’t own you anymore.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People only see one side of a prisoner. Even though we are in this place, we are more than a crime or a number. We are artists, painters, wood-crafters, musicians, singers, and yes, some of us even write a little. I write, not just for me, but for everyone behind a wall, living in a box on the street, or sitting in a lonely room with no one to hear their pain; for the people society chooses to forget.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Legacy in Red</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hunter’s moon rises slowly in a cold, black sky over a forest of thick oak trees whose limbs are bent and twisted from the ravages of time and gravity. Things are as they have been since the day women stopped hunting, a long time ago.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on this night, a single shadow moves through the darkness beneath the trees, not knowing why she is in this place, knowing only that she is heeding an urge that would not be denied. She moves on an errand only vaguely understood, but driven by the need to remember.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An owl hoots in oddly deep tones, as though searching for a reason to do otherwise. Beneath its perch, two wolves pass silently, hunger pains driving them on in their search for the legend, the one known as Red Riding Hood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl does not notice these things as she steps from the trees into a small clearing. Her eyes are focused on the dark cabin before her. She hesitates, wanting to turn and run, but knowing that she has no choice. She pulls her gray cloak tighter around her, steps on the porch and reaches for the doorknob.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside, the small, wrinkled hand of an old crone places a lit candle stub in a saucer. The saucer rests on a worn table marked with runes and words from the time of magic and wildness. An old red cape hangs on a peg by the door. “Huh, one hell of a birthday,” the old woman mutters, amazed that the earth has circled the sun ninety-seven times since she first wore the cape.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature isn’t kind to the flesh, but like last year’s leaf, clinging tightly to the stem, she refuses to wither, looking for a remedy to defy mortality, while painstakingly ensuring her life’s legacy on parchment for future generations. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl is met by the crone at the door. The old woman motions her in. The girl closes the door and hangs her drab cloak on a peg protruding from the wall.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strange</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she thinks. The cabin’s warm, but stranger still is that she can see perfectly, although there is no visible light in the room where she stands. There’s no furniture, and the walls are bare. The cabin is empty except for a chest on the floor in the middle of the room.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old woman points to the chest. She motions to the young girl to open the chest and she complies. She kneels and wipes the dust from the lid, revealing strange markings. She traces them with a finger and speaks the words of a language she did not know, until now.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She places both hands on the lid, the symbols beginning to glow as she opens the chest. A voice speaks softly, coming from nowhere and everywhere at once. “This is your legacy and your destiny”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twelve portraits stare up at her, some etched in dark ink, others painted in swirls of color – generations of women, grandmothers and granddaughters, each wearing the velvet red cloak, the color of blood and huntresses. Their history is recorded on parchment and bound in a leather journal and she reads it from beginning to end. That cloak was made before women had been kept from the woods, confined to kitchens, made to stay only in the village under the watchful eyes of the priest and councilmen. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, beneath the parchment, rests a dagger in a jeweled scabbard. A blade capable of cutting the ties of subjugation, imprisonment, and complicity. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those who had come before, none had been strong enough to find their way without the trail, to defy their mothers, or to find within themselves the wildness of their ancestors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crone, carrying the red cape across her forearms, kneels and offers it to the girl. She stands with resolve, touching her neck where the garment’s clasp will soon rest. It smells like a memory, something untamed and primordial. She remembers some old business, something about a wolf. She turns to meet the forest carrying only the dagger and her wits. She whispers to herself “This ends with me!” and steels herself for a world of trouble. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>by Benjamin Winkler</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can still recite the entirety of Edward Lear’s “The Owl and the Pussy-Cat.” It unknots itself from my tongue with the same cadence as shma-yisrael-adonai-elohainu or the lyrics to “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” It’s almost as if the words themselves are not important but the act of worrying them. I used to carry a turquoise stone and a Garden State Parkway token in my pocket for the same purpose.</p>
<p><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-818" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2.jpg" alt="" width="663" height="497" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2.jpg 540w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of these were central to growing up in south Jersey, between the Pine Barrens and the City, but the memories bound up with this cultural flotsam are much more pleasant: I’m four or five and sitting with my mother on the beige sofa, finger pressed firmly to page, sounding out words like “quince” and “runcible.” I used to carry books with me everywhere, in the car, to school, in the red wagon my parents would pull me up the hill in to the Garden State Discovery Museum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lear’s was the first poem I ever loved and the first I ever memorized, but it was only later I learned to understand the words without the Jan Brett illustrations I knew. And then I wondered what it was like to sail across the ocean, or pierce my nose, or fall in love across a species.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I later stored away lines by Berryman and Bishop, but those are subject to forgetting. I have to look for them, to coax them out like the piggy-wig in the woods. I think the mysteries of memory are a lot like dream-logic: We don’t know why something is there, only that it is and could not be otherwise. We can tease it apart pacing around a living room or on a pricey analyst’s couch, but ultimately that your mind found this important is all the reason you need.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill is a poet who practices her craft exclusively in the Irish language. Born in 1952 in Lancashire, England to Irish parents, she was sent to Ireland at age 5 to live with relatives in the <a href="http://www.udaras.ie/en/an-ghaeilge-an-ghaeltacht/an-ghaeltacht/">Gaeltacht</a> of County Kerry, and later lived in County Tipperary. She studied English and Irish literature at University College Cork, where she met her future husband, the geologist Dogan Leflef. Her relationship with Leflef, a Turk and Muslim, was opposed by her Catholic parents, who made her a ward of the court and forbade her any contact with Leflef. In 1973 Ní Dhomhnaill left Ireland for Turkey to marry Leflef and start a family.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>After 7 years abroad, she returned to the island and published her first collections of poetry, </em>An Dealg Droighinn<em> (&#8220;The Blackthorn Bramble,” 1981) and </em>Féar Suaithinseach<em> (“Marvellous Grass,” 1984). In 1986, she released </em>Selected Poems: Rogha Dánta<em>, featuring her Irish poems alongside English translations by Michael Hartnett.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Apart from her choice to write in a minority language, Ní Dhomhnaill’s work is characterized by its focus on themes such as <a href="https://wfupress.wfu.edu/poem-of-the-week/poem-week-melusine-nuala-ni-dhomhnaill/">gender roles</a>, <a href="https://wfupress.wfu.edu/poem-of-the-week/poem-of-the-week-33/">language</a> and culture, <a href="http://www.poetryinternationalweb.net/pi/site/poem/item/8184/auto/0/THE-WATER-HORSE">sexuality</a>, and <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/92170">mythology</a>. Her poems are abundant in imagery from both local Irish folklore and world-famous legends. Her recent dual-language collection </em>The Fifty Minute Mermaid<em> (2007, trans. Muldoon) is a powerful work that begins with three poems on <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=39425">authoritarianism</a> before heading off into a long series of poems examining the habits and culture of <a href="https://www.inertiamagazine.com/i4/dhomhnaill.html">Irish merfolk</a>. The poems cover topics from mermaid hair-washing and breastfeeding, to the merfolk’s struggles with <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/detail/49339">assimilation</a>, family dysfunction, and religious abuse and hypocrisy. I contacted Ní Dhomhnaill to talk about this collection as well as her thoughts on language, culture, and mythology.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-812"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Your poems are so rich in images and characters from folklore, fairy tales, and mythology, it makes me wonder what role these genres play in your everyday life. Do you regularly read fairy tales or books about folklore and myth, or is your knowledge of folklore drawn from memory and stories you&#8217;ve heard? What inspires you to write a poem using fairy tale/mythical images?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I haven’t read a book of fairy or folktales in years—the last one probably <i>Italian Folktales</i> translated from many different Italian dialects by Italo Calvino, which came into the house in the early ‘80s and was fought over so much by my children Timuchin and Melissa that they tore it in two. (It was a very fat paperback, and they are notorious for falling apart.) I remember having to call down to them once “who has the half that has the introduction?” for something I was writing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But there were no children’s books in the house when I was growing up so I tore through a set of books left from my grandfather—<i>Myths and Legends of the World</i>, a series of scholarly books from the beginning of the 20th century, and it answered a deep need in me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It seems that the archetypal level of reality is much more alive in me than any other level. The same could be said of three of my four children, one of whom writes screenplays, and the other two, who have a real artistic bent. Recently I read that, what with all the neuroscanning, etc. they can do now, that they have found certain strict patterns of brain movements, which are really a physical proof of what Jung intuited as archetypes. I got an email recently from the poet Tom McCarthy, where he mentioned my “brilliantly symbolic life.” I had to laugh. About 10 years ago my father died. He was trodden to death by cattle, which is what you would associate with the Paleolithic rather than the 21st century AD. I happened to meet the writer Nuala O’Faolain on the corner of 2nd Ave and 5th Street in New York City shortly afterwards. I told her what had happened. Her response was “How is it, Nuala, that everything that happens to you has to be so mythological?” So there you have it. I think the mythological level is more active in me than any other, say, realistic, level. So it naturally expresses itself as archetypes, in poetry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But what I really love to do is to go in to the Department of Irish Folklore in University College Dublin and read the stories in the manuscripts there. These give me a physical pleasure so strong, it is all I can do sometimes not to break into tears. This is the oral tradition at its best, what I heard the tail-end of when I was sent to Kerry from England at age 5. A richness of tradition cultivated by the works of thousands of scribes, who wrote down much of the medieval corpus in little copybooks, right up to the time of the Famine, mostly in Munster [province in the south of Ireland] and East Ulster [province in the north of Ireland], so that the oral tradition was enriched enormously. An example, I once spent an afternoon talking to a farmer, Mickey Long, as he dug up potatoes in the autumn. We were looking out over the expanse of Ventry harbour. He told me how, as a young boy in 1912, the whole British Atlantic fleet had come into the harbour and were at rest there. He told me the names of the flagships, the <i>Indefatigable</i>, the <i>Defence</i>, etc. He said he and his friends had rowed out to them and given them mackerel and got cigarettes in return. Then he used a phrase that translated means “the ships were so thick on the water that you could walk from the farthest out of them right into the shore without wetting your feet,” which I recognised at once as a line from the medieval text “The Battle of Ventry,” written in Regensburg in what is now Germany by an Irish monk in 1353. That kind of richness, that was kept alive for centuries, is what I absolutely exult in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>You&#8217;ve suggested in essays and other interviews that there&#8217;s a connection between expressing yourself in Irish and deeper emotional accessibility compared to writing or conversing in English. Can you talk about that? Is it the same for poetry, since you&#8217;ve written more poetry than you have any other form of writing? Do you find poetry a more accessible means for writing about emotions or about the mythical world than other kinds of writing?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I write poetry exclusively in Irish. I can only write poetry in Irish, as it seems to be where my emotions are located. I think rationally mostly in English, because most of the books, etc that I have around me are in English, but that only engages one part of my brain. Feelings come out in Irish. Imagination also. I luckily discovered this at a very young age, at 16, when in the middle of writing a poem in the study (instead of doing my French exercise) I suddenly realized that I was actually writing Irish prosody in English, and that was a stupid thing to be doing, why don’t I write it in Irish? Which I did, and I realized it was much better. The words seemed to sit more naturally on the emotions. I realized I was only a poet in Irish, not English. I never looked back. Irish, for better or worse, is the language of my emotions and imagination, and as I have said earlier, the imagino-emotional level is the most alive part of my psyche, so, ipso facto, it has to be in Irish. Mind you, I didn’t know any of this when I started out. It was by the very act of writing that all this became conscious.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have written the odd short story in Irish also, which I am about to bring together this summer in a collection called after the longest story in the collection, “Sean-chathracha na hAise Bige,” which could be translated as “The Ancient Cities of Asia Minor.” I owe it to Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge [Irish Books Board], so I just have to finish it and clear the decks before I do anything else. My son is always at me to write a memoir, in English, so that the things that happened to me back in the early 1970s do not happen, even in a different form, to anyone else. I am collecting material for it, like going into the Wards of Court office etc, but I see it a few years down the road. In the meantime I am working on a new collection in Irish, <i>Urú</i>, which means an eclipse of both the grammatical and celestial kind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Do you think there&#8217;s something that makes Irish unique in terms of storytelling about the Otherworld, the unseen and unproven, the subconscious or subliminal? Do you think this is an advantage or characteristic of minority languages in general or something special to Irish?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, in a post-religious, increasingly rational and empirical world, anything that keeps the imagino-emotional part of us alive, and allows it to function, is to be cherished and cultured. After all this is what makes us different from, and superior to, robots. Mind you, rationality has its time and place also. After all I was married to a very exact scientist for 40 years, and he was always pulling me up on my “woolly” thinking. And rightly so. I am a great believer in science and what it can discover and create, but it is not the whole picture. We are, rightly or wrongly, only occasionally rational animals. You only have to look at Brexit and the election of Trump to see that. And all the “hooha” in Irish society about illegitimate children throughout the large part of the 20th century is another proof. Think of it, your daughter gets pregnant at 16. The rational reaction should be to be delighted, as it means you have a fertile daughter, and the next generation is accounted for. Instead you had this whole collective reaction of shame and the madness of locking poor young girls in penal institutions, often for their whole lives, and stigmatizing both them and their children <i>ad infinitum</i>. How logical or rational is that? If our emotional and imaginational levels are expressed freely, for instance through the arts, then maybe we can learn not to mix up things and have our emotions express themselves in all kinds of inappropriate manners. I have a very basic theory—that when Irish people switched language to English, their emotions were left behind in the Irish they refused to use or teach to their children. That is what my mermaid poems are all about. When you read the material in the manuscripts in the Department of Folklore, the sheer imaginative richness that pervaded people’s lives is astonishing. And because the medieval manuscript tradition was kept alive for so long, sometimes by ordinary farmhands, who copied them down into paper copies, at night, by the light of seal-oil tapers, Irish does have a long and very rich repertoire for discussing the non-rational and sometimes downright uncanny. I’m sure all languages do, Irish is not an exception. But minority languages, that haven’t undergone the rationalizing effects of Aristotelian schooling, have maybe an advantage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>The Fifty Minute Mermaid</i></b><b> is my favorite collection of yours. It&#8217;s so sharp and complex in observation and emotion, and also so beautiful and evocative in imagery. Most of its poems are about mermaids and merfolk, and many of them are humorous, but there&#8217;s also an underlying sense of trauma throughout the collection. Of the merfolk suffering and surviving, and even inflicting, various forms of trauma. The title of the collection suggests the time of a typical therapy session. I&#8217;ve heard you speak about this collection and about Irish folk beliefs in general as a projection of the Irish people&#8217;s inner landscape, as the unconscious of the community. Can you talk about about that notion and how it affects your use of mythology and folklore in your work? Is there a relationship in your view between folklore or fairy tales and trauma?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m glad you like my mermaids, as a lot of people don’t seem to understand or appreciate them. Because they are not really mermaids, they are my birth family, with scales and gills attached. You see, in Ireland confessional poetry of the kind often written in America is really a no-go, as we are so hugely and deeply related to and networked with each other on this tiny island, and so madly curious about each other. So I take Emily Dickinson’s dictum to heart: “Tell the whole truth, but tell it slant.” Also by changing everyone into merfolk, I can perhaps reach at a truth that goes deeper than just something depending on the significant details of my own life. This is what poetry has always done for me. In doing so, it has helped me from going mad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only now, as I recover from my husband’s death, do I realize that a lot of this madness is still within and around me, and that only by writing can I still keep myself sane. And the folklore material, which I am convinced is a projection outwards of our collective <i>paysage intérieure</i>, is the perfect “objective correlative.” To express many things. Including trauma.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Many of your poems feature islands, either specific ones like the Blaskets (or Ireland of course) or unnamed, mythical islands. Is there a place or landscape you find more inspiring to write about? Where do you most like to write?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact that many of my poems feature islands, well, that has of course a lot to do to the place I was exiled to at age 5. The parish of Ventry, with the Blaskets just around the corner, and a view out at sea to the Scellig Rocks (about to be made famous worldwide by their use as a background in the next Star Wars). I wrote a series of poems called “Imramm” when I was dreaming a lot of islands. I think, retrospectively, that it was about a part of my personality that had been cut off, like an island, and that was emerging from the subconscious and becoming part of my main personality. I find walking Ventry strand a marvellous aid to writing poems, or rather getting the main action of the poem going. I finish it off then later, in the quiet shelter of my tiny little southwest-facing room in Dublin. And I mean tiny—six feet by eight feet. I am very loath to leave it, and will refuse to move anywhere else until I get a suitable substitute.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Do you have a favorite fairy tale or folk tale? If so, which one and why?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, it is known in Irish as either “An Gadharaín Bán” (“the little white dog”) or “An Gabairin Bán” (“the little white goat”). There are a few versions of it in the Department of Folklore material. There is a version from Peig Sayers which I love, but my all-time favourite version is a version by Máire Ruiséal, also known as Cú an Tobair. Actually I found out that it is from a book of Norwegian stories translated into English sometime in the mid-19th century, where it is about a white bear. Of course, there are no bears in Ireland, so the story was naturalized as being about a different animal. P.J. Lynch has illustrated a version of it as <i>East O’ the Sun and West O’ the Moon,</i> which I managed to pick up one time for my kids in America. It is a modern version of the Amor and Psyche story and a wonderful girl’s quest story. It is interesting that it is the story picked by Éilís Ní Dhuibhne for inclusion in the women’s volumes of <i>The Field Day Anthology of Irish Literature</i>. The versions Peig and Máire tell are basically the same but the telling is so different—Peig’s is wonderfully baroque, with all sorts of curlicues and digressions, while Máire’s is very straight, with the wonderful interpolation to [story collector] Joe Daly, who was using the edeophone with her. “Bhi clann an ri amuigh ar an&#8230;a Joe, an féidir liom an focal Bearla a úsáid? The children of the king were playing out in the…Joe, can I use the English word? I can, alright then, Bhi clann an ri amuigh ar an b<i>piazza.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also love the different versions that exist of “The Handless Maiden,” a version of which I used as the introduction to my first book, <i>An Dealg Droighinn</i>. The [book’s title] is the equivalent of the blackthorn thorn that the maiden has to pull out of her brother’s leg, even though he has cut off her hands. I intuitively knew that that was the story of my life. Also, the various versions of the [fairy tale about the] man who unwittingly sells his daughter to the devil, including the well-known one of “Beauty and the Beast.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a whole lot of them but somehow I don’t need them as absolutely totally as I used to. I’ve worked out a lot of my obsessions in my poetry, and so they no longer come back to haunt me.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">The master’s tools can never dismantle the master’s house.<br />
-Audre Lorde</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He forbids us from knowing anything. From finding anything out. From unlocking the door, behind which we suspect there are so many more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He doesn’t leave us alone, as you might have thought, with a ring of keys. He doesn’t leave us with a test after extracting a promise of obedience. Instead, he’s everywhere. He won’t leave us alone. We are given no keys. We don’t have the run of the house, luxurious beds, diamond chokers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, we do our work where we can.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He doesn’t leave us, ever. He hovers around our meals, our games, our songs. Every day, every night, he tells us things, sometimes in a short burst of speech, a tiny phrase. Sometimes he goes on for hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When he’s silent, we thrash in our beds, trembling for more. Will he ever tell us about the door? Will the door ever be a thing he talks about? We tarry at our work. We burn soup.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ask about the door. He says we don’t care enough about the door for him to say anything about it. He says many things about himself, over and over again. He reassures us of his love more than once.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We get tired of this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We get bolder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We want to talk about the door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ask about the door again. He tells us to sit down. The question is too difficult to answer, he says. We are being unfair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He talks about himself, about things, about us, but never about the door.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He won’t look at us anymore. We look at each other instead. We look at the others. And they look at us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, we keep asking him about that door. We are really asking about all the little doors and rooms behind it. We are asking about the whole house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know because we saw the plans. The old woman shared them with us. They were in the cellar wrapped around old garlic bulbs to keep them dry. The old woman had known a time would come to unroll the crumbling paper in the light, to show the plans for the whole house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She knows we have come at last to open these doors. She knows we have come to plumb the house’s depths. We have come to tear it down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And we have come just in time because the plans are faded, almost invisible. The woman might have died. The garlic might have rotted into the paper. All might have been lost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When no one is watching, we tattoo the plans onto our bodies in indigo blue. When we get through that door, we will always know where we are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old woman says the garlic is sprouting now that it’s seen some light. We look at each other. We have forgotten his name. We know where the door is. We have the plans.</p>

The pretty, sweet sister meets an enchanted woman at a well and the woman gives her a peculiar gift: each time she opens her ruby mouth to speak, flowers and gemstones fall from her lips. The other sister tries to replicate the first one’s success but is cursed, rather than blessed, by the enchanted woman. Toads and snakes escape her mouth when she opens her pencil-thin lips. Although Perrault sends the diamond-mouthed sister to marry a prince and the toad-spewing sister into the woods to die, he didn’t really need this ending to clarify which sister was bad and which was good. It would have been clear to readers of Perrault’s day, for whom diamonds were shiny symbols of wealth and toads were associated with devilry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The connection between toads, frogs, and evil has deep roots in Western folklore and religious literature. Throughout the brutal and bloody witch trials of 15th-18th century Europe, toads were frequently considered the familiars of black magick practitioners, hopping about villages to carry out the work of warty, spiteful sorceresses. In Roman mythology, rude villagers forbade the goddess Latona from drinking clear pond water, even after she implored, “‘Why do you refuse me water? Water is free to all. Nature allows no one to claim as property the sunshine, the air, or the water.’” As punishment for their refusal, Latona turned them into frogs.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[2]</a> And in the Bible’s Book of Exodus, the second plague the God of the Hebrews casts upon the Egyptians is that of frogs: “They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That sounds like a terrible plague, but when the Ancient Egyptians weren’t beset with frogs they venerated them. The Egyptian goddess of fertility, Heqet, was frequently represented as a woman with an amphibian head. This association between frogs and fertility was related to a natural phenomenon: millions of frogs were birthed when the Nile flooded, a yearly cycle that provided much-needed water for Egyptian crops. Similar associations are found in Aztec and Ancient Greek cosmologies, recognizing amphibians’ crucial ecological roles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frogs and toads are still important although, these days, they’re dying off. “Today, amphibians enjoy the dubious distinction of being the world’s most endangered class of animals,” Elizabeth Kolbert writes in <em>The Sixth Extinction</em>. The culprit is a deadly fungus called batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). While the origins of Bd are uncertain, one thing seems clear to scientists who study the issue: it was spread by the shipment of Bd-carrying frogs around the world. Two possible vector species, African clawed frogs and North American bullfrogs, are “widely infected with Bd but do not seem to be harmed by it.” The African clawed frogs were transported to other continents for use in pregnancy tests in the 1950s and 60s; North American bullfrogs have both stowed away on ships and been intentionally exported for culinary purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Extinction rates among many other groups are approaching amphibian levels,” Kolbert adds, “It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[3]</a></p>
<p>When I re-read “Diamonds and Toads,” I find myself daydreaming about meeting the enchanted woman at the well. I imagine thousands, maybe millions, of humans&#8211;those of us concerned about the mass extinction racking the earth, an extinction caused by our species&#8211;lining up to talk to her, saying rude things and getting cursed in return. Perhaps some of us would, like the naughty sister, spill toads from our throats, repopulating amphibians across the earth. <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[4]</a> Perhaps the fairy woman would tire of that curse and vary her punishments. Corals and mollusks, leopards and lemurs would leap from our mouths; those very same animals consumed by human spears and axes, guns and poison, by the pavement that has been poured over the earth.</p>
