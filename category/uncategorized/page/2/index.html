		<p style="text-align: justify;">So often the story begins with one of us, the wretched of the earth. <i>There once was a poor woodcutter.</i> <i>There was once a poor fisherman.</i> A widow, an orphan, a blind man. A peasant. You can imagine their hands are as rough as your own. You can imagine their swollen joints and bad teeth. You can imagine any one of them waiting bundled at the bus stop after a double shift, exact change in pocket, no more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The story is about a low person. <i>But because the girl was beautiful.</i> <i>But because the boy was brave.</i> Because they are smart enough, good enough. Because they deserve it, they are lifted up. They marry the handsome prince who sits upon a saddle, or they win the hand of the Tsarâ&#128;&#153;s daughter. The prole becomes rich.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are taught that a happy ending is an ending with glittering gold pieces, perfumes, roasted birds. <i>Wealth. </i>The word itself almost fills your belly. A happy ending would be if you were driving that sweet Lexus idling at the stop light, if you were dressed like the people in big houses on the television screens, if you shopped at Whole Foods or didnâ&#128;&#153;t have to scrub your own toilet. If only you deserved it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Subvertere, </i>Latin: To turn from below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now is the time for us to look for endings that subvert the paradigm of happiness weâ&#128;&#153;ve been taught to seek. Now, because we are waking; now because in our disaster collectivism, we are discovering our power. We must be ready for reimagining, and rebuilding. I offer you a story with a different kind of happy ending. Itâ&#128;&#153;s not the perfect radical story; weâ&#128;&#153;re not meant to question the idea of the benevolent monarch, or the assumption that people need be governed at all. But â&#128;&#156;The Rusty Plateâ&#128;&#157; gives us an ending in which high is brought low; itâ&#128;&#153;s a tale in which we learn to wish for a joy rooted not in becoming that which oppresses us, but in a world in which equality can be realized.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The story comes to us from the oral folklore of the Jews of Egypt:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>There once was a poor man who wanted to bring a fine gift to the king for his birthday. His rich neighbor laughed at him and belittled him, saying, â&#128;&#156;What thing of worth could you possibly have? You may as well take this rusty old plate from your yard!â&#128;&#157; The poor man examined the broken plate, and thought, â&#128;&#156;Yes. Surely it is a very special gift, a gift from my very own yard.â&#128;&#157; He wrapped the plate in clean cloth and set off for the city. When he appeared before the king and unwrapped his gift, the sun shined just so upon its broken edges and it sparkled with all the colors of the rainbow. The rusty spots glittered like diamonds in the light. The king was delighted and amazed. He thanked the poor Jew profusely, and sent him off with a gift in return, a small pouch of gold. </i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But this is not our happy ending. Our happy ending comes not with gold, but with justice:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>The poor man returns to his village, and his wealthy neighbor sees what the king has given him. â&#128;&#156;Imagine,â&#128;&#157; says the rich man, â&#128;&#156;If the king gives this fool coins for worthless junk, how much more will he reward me for a gift of real value?â&#128;&#157; So he sells his nice house, his land and goats and embroideries, to buy a plate of solid gold. The bourgeois man sets out for the city, thinking smugly that he will find such favor with the king that he will become a very rich, very powerful man indeed. And itâ&#128;&#153;s true that the king is stunned by the beauty of the manâ&#128;&#153;s gift. He exclaims â&#128;&#156;How can I ever thank you? Yes, I know! I will give you my finest and most prized possession!â&#128;&#157;</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is our happy ending, a happy ending for a new world:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>The rich man looks into the pouch the king has given him, and he finds his neighborâ&#128;&#153;s rusty plate. </i></p>

His work has appeared in </em>Black Warrior Review, Conjunctions, Tin House,<em> and elsewhere. Originally from Hawaii and the San Francisco Bay Area, he was educated at Grinnell College and Southern Illinois University. He is the managing editor ofÂ </em><a href="https://psychopompmag.com/">Psychopomp Magazine</a><em>, and an assistant professor of creative writing at St. Olaf College in Minnesota. He is currently working on a second story collection and a novel.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Sequoia Nagamatsuâ&#128;&#153;s story collection </em>Where We Go When All We Were Is Gone<em> is haunting and watery, full of tales of love and loss, but it also has bright surprises of wit and whimsy. His stories are set in Japan and populated by monsters of both traditional folklore and pop culture sci-fi, from the</em> yÅ&#141;kai<em> with its elastically fantastic neck to the atomic and iconic Godzilla.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Growing up as a third-generation Japanese American, what kind of exposure did you have to Japanese folklore? Were Japanese stories part of your familyâ&#128;&#153;s connection to their culture?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from some of the more famous tales, such as <i>MomotarÅ&#141;</i> the Peach Boy, I never really encountered Japanese folklore as a child. No one except for my great-grandmother spoke Japanese, and it was difficult for many of us to find a link to our heritage through her. That said, I did attend temple every weekend as a child (my mother was a member of one of the so-called â&#128;&#156;newâ&#128;&#157; religions), and services consisted of songs and dances that told tales of sorts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>When did you become interested in learning more about Japanese folklore? How do you feel the folklore of Japan has influenced the development of your personal ethnic identity?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Iâ&#128;&#153;ve always been fascinated with myths and legends from an early age, but it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t until I reached college that I started to explore the tales of other cultures as an anthropology major. Even then, it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t until I moved to Japan that my interest in Japanese folklore really took off (in part as a way to explore my heritage). The fantastic in literature, whether it be inspired by folklore or otherwise, is often part of a tradition of critiqueâ&#128;&#148;social, psychological, emotional, individual. Folkloric monsters can serve as an allegory and a lens into modern life, emphasizing aspects of the human condition and society while, especially in the case of Japan, being a reminder of an old world that can never completely be reclaimed. As a Japanese American whose family has in many ways lost touch with our heritage, my foray into Japanese folklore was an effort to at least dip my toes in the magical ponds of my great-grandmotherâ&#128;&#153;s home.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>by A. Marie Carter</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My sister and I play a game. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a game of a sovereignty of sorts, and itâ&#128;&#153;s played out inside the front cover of every storybook our family owns. Her name is written in neat print, at the top, there first, claiming ownership from the start. My name is always scrawled underneath; the desperate scribble of the second sister who came after all the gifts had already been given. I too own this book, it seems to say. But <em>sheâ&#128;&#153;s</em> always the first, three years my senior. Her name is always already there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-758" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1.jpg" alt="" width="813" height="615" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1.jpg 813w,https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1-300x227.jpg 300w,https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1-768x581.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Itâ&#128;&#153;s inside an exquisite copy of <em>The Twelve Dancing Princesses</em>Â that her name irks me most. I adore this book, a present from our grandmother, with its intricate illustrations by Errol Le Cain. Each sister is drawn in a gown embellished with a different fruit or flower, and her dresses, her headwear, even her delicate dancing shoes, are themed to match. I spend countless hours examining these pictures, trying to decide which sister I want to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Am I the youngest princess, whose dresses are adorned with flowers of orange and tangerine? Or can I be another one? I canâ&#128;&#153;t be the one who wears wine-dark grapes in her hair because she is the eldest and my own sister is already just like her, quiet and wise, while I, like the storyâ&#128;&#153;s youngest, am all clamour and noise. Standing in between them are ten other women, in varying shades of our own selves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The youngest sister in this story is terrified of noises in the dark, scared by the snap of a golden twig, by the footsteps of an invisible soldier. I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to be that sister. I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to be the one who is always afraid, who is frightened by things she cannot see. So I try hard to be the boldest, to be the bravest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But when our grandmother dies I am the one who sits stupefied by her bedside, unable to speak anything but sobs, while my sister says all there is that needs to be said. The thank yous, the admissions of love. The acknowledgment of things that pass between girls and grandmothers. For all my bravado, it is her that takes the burden even though, strangely, I wanted it. But I canâ&#128;&#153;t begrudge her that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just like in all the fairy tales, itâ&#128;&#153;s the eldest who inherits the throne.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/513px-Thakurmar_Jhuli_Dakkhinaranjan_Mitra_Majumder_1907.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-730 alignright" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/513px-Thakurmar_Jhuli_Dakkhinaranjan_Mitra_Majumder_1907.jpg" alt="" width="332" height="387" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/513px-Thakurmar_Jhuli_Dakkhinaranjan_Mitra_Majumder_1907.jpg 513w,https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/513px-Thakurmar_Jhuli_Dakkhinaranjan_Mitra_Majumder_1907-257x300.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px"></a>Every Bengali child grows up with <em>Thakurmar Jhuli</em>. They are the canonical set of fairy tales and folk talesâ&#128;&#147;the stories told and retold countless times. Growing up on the western coast of India, I had no affinity with Bengali culture or literature, but every night when my mother couldn’t improvise anymore, an old hardbound copy of <em>Thakurmar Jhuli</em> would eventually come out of the cupboard. Growing up away from Bengal made my mother try harder to pass on whatever stories she had to tell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The book went through so many years of reading to various children that barely any of the pages were held with the binder. The pages slipped over, spilled out held together by measly threads. The book was difficult to read because of its sliding papers, so on some nights my grandfather and grandmother would borrow tropes from the <em>Thakurmar Jhuli</em> and Hindu myths to create stories. Unlike my mother, they didnâ&#128;&#153;t struggle with the act of storytelling without reference. It was as if my grandparents were a dynamic database of folk-tales algorithmically churning out new combinations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Indian myths were once folktales and fairy tales bereft of institutionalized religiousness. It isn’t surprising that my grandparents switched between folk and religious forms unhesitatingly. Regional variations in the epics of <em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Ramayana</em> are now well-known fact with deviations of minor deities and themes. Stories of some deities did not even exist in neighbouring regions. I was told constantly from childhood of how the myths represented certain historical imaginationsâ&#128;&#147;folk historiography accounted for the transformation of princes and princesses into Gods and Goddesses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most common motif that my grandfather would borrow from the stories and repeat was the separation of two princely brothers during their search for a princess kidnapped by a monster. Eventually two knives would be planted at a tree and the brothers would head separate ways. The knife would rust if the respective brother died. One brother always died, and one rescued the princess. Flying chariots were also common, fueled by the Indian mythical TV series that were being aired on national televisionâ&#128;&#147;adaptations of <em>Mahabharata</em> and <em>Ramayana</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A copy of the book still exists in my new house tucked away with old cassettes and CDs. All the stories have not stayed with me after so many years, but what fascinates me in retrospect is the zeal of storytelling that my grandparents displayed, reinventing narratives everyday in the anonymity of private lives. The closest analogy of such acts of storytelling that I can think of in the present are the fan fiction writers of today, delving into storytelling without any desire for immediate material gains.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a danger that leaked through those pages, a draw to ways of thinking that my parents deemed unsuitable for a good little girl to be exposed to; magic and spells, mystical creatures and witches, violence and blood. I was relegated to the watered-down Disney versions which modeled the type of young woman my parents wanted me to be:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Subdued. Subservient. Dependent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My first, unadulterated access to the original version of a fairy tale was Lewis Carrollâ&#128;&#153;s <em>Aliceâ&#128;&#153;s Adventures in Wonderland</em>. As a teenager more focused on getting my driverâ&#128;&#153;s license and graduating high school as early as I could, I was beyond the age of superficial enchantment and Â delight at the array of fanciful characters and silly riddles. I was instead struck by one of Aliceâ&#128;&#153;s seemingly nonsensical questions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>â&#128;&#156;But if Iâ&#128;&#153;m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I?â&#128;&#157;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was already a couple of years deep into trying to answer this question. I had, like Alice, seen something in my world that didnâ&#128;&#153;t make sense and I chased that anomaly down its own rabbit-hole. She and I had both been drinking out of bottles that made parts of ourselves smaller and larger. She changed physically but I drank because I didnâ&#128;&#153;t understand myself. It helped me keep these new burgeoning parts of myself contained so I could fit through that small door into the garden of self-medicated bliss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>â&#128;&#156; â&#128;&#147; at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.â&#128;&#157;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At home I was still expected to be the obedient daughter, to not ask questions, to do what was expected of me. Under my parentsâ&#128;&#153; watchful eyes I was a model of perfection. Then I would sneak away, and the control I had to maintain over my behavior would evaporate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>â&#128;&#156;Oh you canâ&#128;&#153;t help that,â&#128;&#157; said the cat: â&#128;&#156;Weâ&#128;&#153;re all mad here.â&#128;&#157;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would drink until I blacked out. I seduced older men so they would sneak me into bars. I started smoking cigarettes. I raced cars. I got into physical fights. Every moment I had spent suppressed at home manifested in a stunning display of self-destruction. I was the Mad Hatter let loose on the world and its reaction only fueled my insanity. I was the gardeners painting the white roses red in an attempt to deceive those who held power over them. I was the Queen of Hearts yelling <em>â&#128;&#156;Off with their heads!â&#128;&#157;</em> whenever I would sober up enough to notice that no matter the color I splashed on everything it was a hollow action that brought about no change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But mostly, I was Alice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>â&#128;&#156;But itâ&#128;&#153;s no use now,â&#128;&#157; thought poor Alice, â&#128;&#156;to pretend to be two people! Why, thereâ&#128;&#153;s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!â&#128;&#157;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was Alice, curious about what she was experiencing but not happy. I was lost between lands, not sure of my destination but aware that I could not live long in this limbo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>â&#128;&#156;She generally gave herself good advice (though she very seldom followed it).â&#128;&#157;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was Alice. We were both naÃ¯ve young girls who survived long falls and traversed paths fraught with unknowns. Now when I look back at my adventures, they too seem something like a fantastical dream, but unlike Alice I did not simply wake up. I had to stop heeding the labels that said â&#128;&#156;Drink Meâ&#128;&#157; and let myself grow steadily until I realized that my Wonderland was a restraint, not a fantasy. I climbed back out of the rabbit-hole and emerged a stronger and surer version of myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>â&#128;&#156;For you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.â&#128;&#157;</em></p>

(My mother is a master of disguise.) Growing up, she told me stories of Judith beheading Holofernes and the goddess Heraâ&#128;&#153;s endless revenges. She taught me how to break up with people, that feng shui is good for increasing energy and fooling stain-sniffing landlords. She taught me that mud can be beautiful and that blood is powerful, even sacred, especially when shed in sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If she ever wore her dead ring to ward off the whispers, I cannot recall. But we were there all along, my brother and I, the curse our village elders called a blessing, forever lingering at her side, reminding.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She must be a witch, I often think, to be so singular, so shunned and so willfully misunderstood. To unravel her skin each night and sew it back thicker each morning. To cross those moats our fickle neighbors tried digging between us. To sink her feet boldly into their stinging waters and pull forth her own mythic swords of power.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She must be a witch, the way our neighbors shrank from us after the divorceâ&#128;&#148;divorced from a pastor, no less!â&#128;&#148;narrowing their eyes and snarling back their lips at her. She who turned away their rubbernecker casseroles. Who bore their judgement without blinking. Whose story refused to end on its provided page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because the witch, you see, is endless. Boundless.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She builds homes out of gingerbread and theater, a smiling enchantress spinning plates on a stage. She carves runes into her skin, squeezing out living red power across her grimoiresâ&#128;&#153; pages, smearing it over us, her children, like war-paint; a spell for protection, a spell to blind us to her pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laughing, she lifts her dripping hands to the skyâ&#128;&#148;all of it defiant, undeniable proof of Her. The Witch. She who so loves the worldâ&#128;&#153;s ghosts, yet will never succumb to joining them.</p>

She is the author of two forthcoming books: </em>Literary Witches<em> (Hachette/ Seal 2017), a collaboration with illustrator Katy Horan, and </em>Ask Baba Yaga<em> (Andrews McMeel 2017), based on her advice column in </em>The Hairpin<em>. Her poetry can be found in literary journals such as </em>Crazyhorse, Guernica, Fence,<em> and many more. Poems from her “Queen Harp” manuscript will be published in the upcoming Translucent Issue of </em>Fairy Tale Review<em>. I interviewed her about the influences of folklore in her work, her portrayals of feminine characters, and various witches.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Baba Yaga is a witch from Slavic folklore and mythology, and you invoke her character in an advice column and your upcoming book, <em>Ask Baba Yaga</em>. What was your first introduction to this mythology? Was there a particular story you remember being told, or one that has become your favorite?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before my family moved to America, when I was five years old, we lived in a city called Irkutsk by Lake Baikal in southern Siberia. We had a summer house, or dachyaâ&#128;&#148;almost everybody in Russia, at the time, had a summer houseâ&#128;&#148;edged between the lake and the woods. These were deep woods, very magical and mysterious; one of my earliest memories is of my parents saying I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t go berry picking with them because we might run into bears. I must have heard about Baba Yaga early on, because I knew that she lived in those woods along with the bears. I felt her nearby, creeping around, making concoctions in her hut that moved around on chicken legs. Even when we went back to Irkutsk, she was close. I remember taking a walk with my mother through a city park and seeing Baba Yagaâ&#128;&#153;s face in the hollowed-out part of a tree.</p>

Sparse and haunting, ballads are usually sung without instrumentation and tell melancholy tales of betrayal and lost love. Many draw on traditional literature–like folklore and fairy tales–and the medieval romance tradition. I wanted to know more, so I asked my friend <a href="http://www.sarosings.com/">Saro Lynch-Thomason</a>, a folklorist and ballad singer, a few questions.</em></p>
<p><em>Lynch-Thomason–who is based in Asheville, North Carolina–is also an illustrator, author, and social activist. In 2012 she completed </em><a href="http://www.blairpathways.com/">Blair Pathways: A Musical Exploration of Americaâ&#128;&#153;s Largest Labor Uprising</a><em>–a researched compilation of over 20 historic songs from West Virginiaâ&#128;&#153;s labor wars. Saro has led the Asheville Community Sing since 2010 and regularly teaches regional ballad workshops, Wassailing choruses, and May Day choruses on social justice themes. In 2013, Saro completed her solo CD </em><a href="https://sarolyncht.bandcamp.com/album/vessel">Vessel</a><em>–an acappella compilation of ballads and songs from Appalachia and the British Isles. Her distinct, powerful singing style transports audiences to Appalachian mountain hollers, 19th-century coal camps and old meeting houses.</em></p>
<p>(As a heads up, this interview mentions sexual assault.)</p>
<p><strong>Ballad singing traveled from the British Isles to Appalachia, where you live. Can you tell me a little bit about ballad singing, how it originated and how it ended up in the U.S. Mountain South?</strong></p>
<p>Ballads as they are often referred to today reference a particular story-song form that has been in Europe for nearly 1,000 years. Often a ballad involves first or third person narration, a simple rhyme scheme and a repeated melody. In the 1100s and 1200s, this form of storytelling was popular across what is modern-day France and Spain. A class of minstrels, supported by nobility, traveled and composed poetry and songs in this format. Over 2,000 poems have survived from this period, along with hundreds of melodies.</p>
<p>Since then there have been several periods of songwriting popularity, during which everyone from nobles to peasants took an interest in creating and singing their own ballads. Many ballads were written in the Middle Ages, about 300 of which survive today. But many ballads come from a revival period that began in the 1600s and had its heyday with the creation of the letterpress. People wrote and dispersed songs across Europe and America, drawing on old melodies and themes but with updated characters and political messaging.</p>
<p>During this period many ballads came to America, brought by immigrants from England, Ireland, and Scotland who arrived throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Immigrants families carried and adapted these songs for generations as they worked and settled across the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, the Piedmont in North Carolina, and the Appalachian Mountains. These song styles became dispersed into Afro-Appalachian communities as well, where people continued to change them.</p>

		<p><em>Write us a folk or fairy-tale essay in the form of map.</em></p>
<p>This map can be an image, cartoon, written essay, photograph, video, audio, Google map, interactive media or in any other medium you can think of. It can be a traditional essay or image that “maps” a certain landscape, journey or idea; or it could take the concept of a “map” and reinterpret it in a whole new way. You can graft a folk or fairy tale on to a map of a certain place, or make a map out of a folk or fairy tale that you love. There’s virtually no wrong way to interpret this prompt–just let your imagination run wild, have fun with it and send us your best work!</p>
<p>One first-place winner will receive a copy of the Mauve Issue of <em>Fairy Tale Review</em>, signed by founding editor Kate Bernheimer, and will have their work published by <em>Tiny Donkey</em> in January 2016. Up to three other winners will also have their essays published throughout the month of January.</p>
<p>Submissions will be accepted from September 1 until January 1. Written essays should be 400 words or less. Visual submissions should consist of just one image. Video, audio and interactive media submissions should be two minutes or under in length. Please email submissions to tinydonkeyeditorial@gmail.com or upload them to <a href="https://fairytalereview.submittable.com/submit">our online submission manager</a> under the <em>Tiny Donkey</em> category. Please put “Maps Contest” in the submission subject line.</p>
