								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">by Murad Jalilov<a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic.jpg"><br />
<img class="wp-image-908 alignright" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic-261x300.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="343" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic-261x300.jpg 261w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic.jpg 555w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Growing up Goychay, Azerbaijan, I would always hear my grandmother telling tales of old, some more interesting than others. She always told them at night in her loud-yet-soothing voice. The ones that stuck out the most were the fairy tales that were meant to frighten, such as “Adamcil” (Man-Eater), a tale of a humanoid with long horns and claws, covered in fur, eating human corpses, and “Isah and Musah,” the tale of a bird that mimics the cries of two brothers lost in a forest. These tales had a certain eerie charm to them and always blended with the mysterious nature and sounds of the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the better ways of introducing the public to a new culture is through folklore, more specifically fairy tales. As an immigrant from Azerbaijan, I’ve seen the current trends in American society where diversity is being somewhat celebrated, despite the current political rhetoric. It made me realize that I have something of my own to bring into this country and to its culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Azerbaijan’s geographical position as a country between the Middle East and Europe, surrounded by countries such as Russia, Iran and Turkey, made it an ancient hub for cultural exchange, creating a relatively unique folklore. The story that reflects this the most is “The Tale of Malikmammad,” about a young prince who journeys into the Dark World and has to face creatures from European folklore, like ogres and dragons, and a creature from Turkic folklore called the Emerald Bird (Zumrud/Konrul). There are also Azerbaijani versions of western tales such as “Cinderella” (“Göyçək Fatma”) and “The Three Goats” (“Şəngülüm, Şüngülüm, Məngülüm”). There are also plenty of tales about animals, usually with human traits, such as “Trickster Goat,” which tells the story of a goat that outsmarted a bear, a wolf, and a fox.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, a very limited number of Azerbaijani fairy tales have been translated into English, one of them being “Jirtan: The Little Boy Who Fought Monsters,” published in <em>Azerbaijan International Magazine</em> in 1996. Beyond this example, it is almost impossible to find English translations for fairy tales in the language, even for those that are known well among the Azerbaijani people, and it’s a shame that so much folklore is lost behind the language barrier. Fortunately, the age of information has connected people from around the world, making it much easier for cultures to share their heritage online for all to read and translate. Other than websites dedicated to collecting fairy tales and folklore, for me personally the web makes it easier to stay in touch with my relatives in Azerbaijan on a much more frequent basis, which allows me to ask them for fairytales that have never been recorded online or in print.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is essential that these fairy tales are translated into English and introduced to the wider public to add the voice of a culture that has been silent for years. Unfortunately, there is little interest in literarily translating Azerbaijani literature into English among those who speak both languages, and there are even fewer people versed in creative writing in English on a college level. Azerbaijani fairy tales will bring new ideas and enrich the literature that is available in English. For this reason, I have been inspired to add the cultural artifacts I brought with me, in the form of fairy tales, to the ever-growing melting pot that is the US, through literary translation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Trickster Goat </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Translated by Murad Jalilov and N.K Valek</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once there was and once there wasn’t a group of people moving from the mountains to the plains. A Goat, a Calf, and a Sheep from the herds were in a hidden place eating grass and were not aware that their people were leaving them. When they raised their heads, however, their people were already gone. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Calf went to the Goat. “Brother Goat,” he cried, “the wolf is going to eat us! Please find us a way!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goat replied, “Let us find a hut and start living in it.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three of them agreed and started searching for a hut. Along the way, they found the pelt of a bear for the Calf, and pelt of wolf for the Goat and a pelt of fox for the Sheep to cover themselves with. After some more wandering, they finally found a hut and happily entered it, only to find a Bear, a Wolf, and a Fox having a chat.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bear spoke happily to the fox, “Grandfather Fox, please bring me a piece of wood.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fox brought a piece of wood from the corner. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bear put the wood on his chest and started singing, “Ring, my lute, ring: Today I ate a calf, and another fell down the chimney.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wolf took the wood from the Bear and sang, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a goat, and another one came to me willingly.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the Fox took the wood. “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a sheep and shall have another one!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing all this, the Goat told the Sheep, “Bring me a piece of wood.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sheep gave the Goat the piece of wood. The Goat put the wood on his chest and started singing, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a wolf, covered myself with its pelt, and I shall eat another one.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he gave the wood to the Calf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Calf took the wood and sang, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a bear, covered myself with its pelt, and I shall eat another one.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Calf gave the wood to the Sheep, who also sang, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a fox, covered myself with its pelt, and I shall eat another one.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Fox heard this, it ran out the hut, followed by the Wolf and the Bear. The Goat told his comrades, “This trick saved our lives. They will have time to think while they run and they will return to eat us. Let’s run somewhere else.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them agreed to leave. They wandered for a little, and they stumbled upon a rock. They decided to climb the rock and lie down there. Meanwhile the Bear, the Wolf and the Fox were still running. Suddenly the Wolf spoke up, “Hey, a goat, a calf and a sheep won’t be able to eat us. They tricked us. Let’s go back and eat them.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they returned to the hut, they found it to be abandoned. They followed the track of the three animals and stumbled upon a rock. They saw the Goat, the Calf and the Sheep on top of the rock. Once the Calf noticed the Bear’s scary gaze, he got frightened, slipped and fell from the rock. The Goat seeing this yelled as loud as he could:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Brother Calf, go get the bear, and we’ll take care of the wolf and the fox!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing this, the Fox ran off, and the Wolf and the Bear followed. The three herd friends laughed for a while together. Later all three of them found a way to the plains and rejoined the herds of their people. </span></p>

The second omen: the House of Authority burst in flames.  The third evil omen was the straw temple of the god of fire got struck by lightning.  The fourth: fire streamed through the sky on a sunny day.  The fifth: wind lashed Lake Texcoco into a flood.  The sixth evil omen was the weeping sound night after night crying, “My children, we must flee!”  The seventh: fishermen caught an odd bird, ash colored with a mirror in its head that showed the night sky. They brought the bird to emperor Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin.  He looked in the mirror and saw a vision of the war of pale men riding deer. He looked once more and the odd bird was gone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The eighth omen was me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A two-headed man was seen in the streets of Tenochtitlan.  The seers said that he was deformed. That he was an oddity. They took him to emperor’s zoo of human curiosities and eventually to the Casa Denegrida&#8211;the room with no windows painted all black in which the emperor meditated in darkness on what the seers told him. When Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin came to the Black House to see him, this evil omen, Two-Heads had disappeared.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More recent scribes write that the Mexica scribes, who recorded the omen of Two-Heads decades after the conquest, must have been alluding to the formation of the new race, the mestizo. And today, when you see me with my two heads creeping around the streets of California, it is still an omen.  The pocho, the Anglo-Chicano, the coconut. The coming again of the mixed blood, mixed culture of European and Native American.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American scribes have already foretold this through their haruspication of population science and census projections.  Aztecs called these omens evil, and likewise the American scribes portray the Anglo-Chicano with xenophobia, as a crisis to be solved, a Mexapocalypseomen of the end times of Anglo privilege. Behold the terror of the future.  Two-heads, the coming of the mestizo, the looming exotic native norm. Being led into the Casa Denegrida of your mind at night, into your dreams of who you are and what you will be.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>by Psyche Z. Ready</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have always loved stories of cross-dressing heroines. It’s a familiar trope in literature, legends, and fairy tales: a woman dresses as a man to solve some problem, or to save the day. In her male guise, she is strong, brave, skillful, and clever.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> At the end of the tale, however, when the conflict is resolved, she usually puts back on her apron and returns home. In many variants, home is a controlling father, a bullying brother, or a drunken husband. In my search for variants, I found another tale type that ends differently. In “The Shift of Sex,” or ATU 514<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[2]</a> , the heroine does not go home after her adventures, but stays in her male disguise and eventually <i>becomes </i>a man. Most variants follow this narrative (I’ve used the gendered pronouns given in most sources):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>An elderly father is asked by the king to enter military service. Because he is old and has no sons, his daughter dresses in his clothes, borrows his horse, and joins for him. With the help of her magical horse, she excels at all she does. She quickly becomes the king’s favorite soldier, and his daughter falls in love with her. When the community begins to doubt that she is a man, they set her on impossible quests that she completes easily. Her final battle is with a demon or witch, who curses her with their dying breath: “If you are a man, be now a woman! If you are a woman, be now a man.” The hero returns home to his castle where he is celebrated, his wife rejoices, and they all live happily ever after.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Shift of Sex” is a very old and widespread tale: it has been told for at least two, possibly three thousand years<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[3]</a> , across Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas. There are at least twenty-six variants in English today, and I have spent the last year researching them. In <a href="http://mars.gmu.edu/bitstream/handle/1920/10314/Ready_thesis_2016.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">my academic work</a> on the subject, I argue that this tale type was historically a space to express frustrations at the limitations of the female gender. Today, however, this tale has the potential to hold space for a broader expression of gender identity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-784 aligncenter" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2.jpg" alt="" width="407" height="479" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2.jpg 522w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2-255x300.jpg 255w" sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An issue that some modern readers have with this tale is that, while it begins as a queer romance between two women, it ends with what feels like a return to heteronormativity. When the protagonist changes gender, the couple becomes heterosexual. Some readers interpret the story as a narrative message that says a happy ending for two women in love is impossible. The story is read as a <i>condemnation</i> of queer love. I read this story, however, not as a queer romance gone hetero, but as a trans love story with a happy ending. I would not argue that audiences thousands of years ago saw the protagonist in this tale as transgender<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[4]</a>, but present-day audiences certainly can.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the many variants of this tale type, there are differences in narrative structure, tone, and detail, but the one element that is present in each is the happy ending: the princess is overjoyed that her partner has changed gender, and she and the royal family accept him, and they live happily ever after. Historically, our literary and popular narratives are lousy with stories of characters who transgress gender roles or heteronormativity and suffer for it; even contemporary stories with queer and non-binary characters <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays">kill them off</a>, or <a href="http://www.glaad.org/publications/victims-or-villains-examining-ten-years-transgender-images-television">depict them as monsters</a>. The message spoken by these narratives is clear: any transgression of traditional gender and sexuality will be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While we as a culture continue the struggle to create happy endings for transgressive and transgender characters in our own popular literature, we can take heart that there is a folktale that has been told and retold for thousands of years with a transgressive, cross-dressing, sex-changing protagonist who is not punished, but rewarded for their bravery, skill, and strength with wealth, marriage, and a happy life.</p>

Folklorists Pauline Greenhill and Emilie Anderson-Grégoire discuss ATU 514 at length in Unsettling Assumptions: Tradition, Gender, Drag.</p>
<p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1">[3]</a> A variant appears in Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>, which dates to 8 CE; another in the Indian <em>Mahabarata</em>, which originates in the 7th or 8th century BCE; and also “Alimbeglanya” in the Ossetian Nart Sagas, which were compiled around 2,000 BCE.</p>
<p><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1">[4]</a> These tales were told long ago and in disparate regions with notions of sex, gender, and gender identity unquestionably different from our own; to apply a contemporary understanding of gender identity to these cultures is a form of conceptual colonialism.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Every story begins with a story that you already know: something that is entrenched in your core despite it seeming completely foreign at first—the moment when you realize that you dislike the bitter taste of almonds; the sight of your own blood as you dab at it with your thumb—the scarlet seeping into the ridges of your fingerprints before you rinse your body of itself clear in the bathroom sink.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the edge of my bed, a bookshelf filled with hardcovers—texts that I could call “mine” in a way that children claim things; all things received as a gift; the ornate pages, the gold trim that I would scratch at with my fingernails if I hadn’t already bitten them to flatness. The stories, too, were mine: girls and boys and frogs and toads rooted to my stomach, curving their way around the bumps in my spine, as if they had always been there, just beneath the surface, leaving their marks on the inside of my skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The games too, were mine, in a different way: whereas the stories of my youth were found within, as if they had been stitched into my core, the games were explosive in their moments—they burst into my world from the exterior, and it was my duty to capture those days sitting on a stained carpet in an upstairs hallway trying to make this other version of myself run fast enough that the boomerang would get lost amongst the rocks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These too, were stories that I already knew: of awakening in a land where all things are equal and the touch of a fleck of light could kill you where you stood—these stories of danger, or warning, of beware the outside, but push forward toward an unknown end and eat all of the fruit whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a time when I would have to shut the game off, but I could enter a different world through the pages at the foot of my bed, often scanning the same stories over and over before it was time to put my glasses on the nightstand and let all worlds blur. Some nights, when the room was too warm from the heat of all of the electronics, I could see the images of the parallax scrolling still engrained in the darkness, glowing a warm red, even when all of the lights were out—a constant revisiting, as if I were the vacuum tube casting images against the blackened windows.</p>

<p><strong>A note for readers: this essay mentions sexual violence.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff.jpg"><img class="wp-image-576 alignright" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff-215x300.jpg" alt="bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff" width="313" height="437" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff-215x300.jpg 215w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bc0da84b13315d7d46f4457197fb0aff.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /></a>In folklore, the term “transformation chase” refers to the use of shapeshifting as a means of combat or escape. The wizard duel in the animated film <em>The Sword In The Stone</em>, for one, but more traditionally the plot of several Celtic ballads. &#8220;The Ballad of Tam-Lin&#8221; was included in a book of folktales I had as a child, translated from song to prose. I remember loving it. I remember the way the name “Tam-Lin” felt on my Russian tongue, liquid and strong. For those unfamiliar with the story, it goes like this: a girl comes upon Tam-Lin in the woods of Carterhaugh, where he is being held prisoner by the Queen of Fairies. To rescue him from the Queen and win him as a lover, the girl must hold him fast through countless transformations: a roaring lion, a terrifying snake, the painful scald of flame. To my young sensibilities, this seemed extremely romantic. I appreciated the ritual of endurance; trials and pageantry were a necessity of love stories because some outside force willed it, not because of the lovers themselves. Years later, &#8220;The Ballad of Tam-Lin&#8221; made me pissed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Granted, what sounds romantic to a four-year-old-girl can hardly be expected to ring true to a thirty-year-old non binary queer person. All the same, I wanted to slice apart this story with my feminist lance — which is like a feminist lens, but for folktales. The basic premise of &#8220;Tam-Lin,&#8221; where a woman holds a man as he hurts her, was no longer abstract but a common narrative played out through a million books and films fetishizing a woman’s abnegation and self-sacrifice for the sake of a man’s potential. &#8220;Tam-Lin&#8221; became our culture’s unfortunate connection between pain and love, equating the latter with a willingness to suffer on behalf of another. “It’s only true if you bruise by the force of it,” as Chris Corner once said. Fuck. What had originally drawn me to such a sexist, heteronormative depiction of devotion? A poem from my poetry collection,<em> Salt Is For Curing</em>, tried to understand: “She holds and she hurts and / she wins. Maybe I liked it because the woman / is doing something, not waiting. It&#8217;s always / either waiting or hurting, you know, and often / one can’t tell the difference.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet the more I thought about it, the more &#8220;The Ballad of Tam-Lin&#8221; seemed itself to change shape, to become something other than what I had previously seen. As I looked back on an extremely difficult period of my life when I frequently lashed out in anger and attempted to isolate myself from those around me — and as I thought about the people who remained by my side throughout this — I began to see &#8220;Tam-Lin&#8221; not as a patriarchal narrative of pain-acceptance but as one where a character holds another through change. Tam-Lin did not become a flame and slowly burn hotter; he shifted indiscriminately, the changes done to him as he assumed monstrous forms akin to those in body-horror films like <em>The Fly</em> or <em>Tusk</em>. The transformation chase in &#8220;Tam-Lin&#8221; is a battle against the Fairy Queen and not really between the two individuals. In this forest, the courage required in love is made literal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be forcibly changed, especially as a means of achieving freedom, is a strong metaphor that does double-duty here: the girl can leave the forest and head home any time, but enduring the transformations is the only way for Tam-Lin to escape the Fairy Queen. Someone we love can certainly assume different shapes to frighten or hurt us, but the experiences that make us shift and change are as varied as all the animals in the wood of Carterhaugh. Which is to say: is it possible that there is something beautiful in love’s tenacity? Not in the sense that it’s good or admirable to endure pain, but in the sense that a transformation chase represents the monstrous qualities people display as they pass through tragedy — the qualities we might take on during the processing of grief or trauma. This link of change with pain, especially in the context of external pain (vis-à-vis the Fairy Queen), is in some ways a very honest look at any long-term relationship, where we must each see the other’s wounds and mold each other back into, if not our perfect form, then at least something passable. A transformation chase is not discomfort for the sake of another but the choice to remain by their side in a moment of shared discomfort — because, after all, it is only in fairy tales that change can happen with something as easy as a kiss.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A note for readers: this essay mentions physical and sexual violence. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once I tried reading a 900-page book called <i>A Treasury of American Folklore</i>, by the folklorist B.A. Botkin. But I only got 60 pages in before dumping the “treasure” at a book swap.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was the stories of Mike Fink that did it, a Mississippi River boatman of the post-American Revolution era celebrated for his outrageous boasts and pranks. His boasts were of the variety that he could “outrun, outjump, outshoot, outdrink, and lick any man in the country.” And his pranks? Well, he had a curious sense of fun, this Mike Fink, and a suspiciously specific kind of targets. Like the time he shot an African-American boy walking by in the heel just because he didn’t like its shape, and the time he shot the scalp-lock off a Cherokee man’s head for acting too proud, or the time he made his wife lie in a pile of leaves and set them on fire, letting her go just after her hair and clothes started burning, all for looking at another man.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Botkin labels Fink a “pseudo bad man” without explaining what that means. Along with many other folklorists who’ve written about Fink, he tries to assure us modern folks that Fink wasn’t real, or at least, his pranks weren’t. They couldn’t be, could they?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though I’d never heard of Mike Fink before this, I don’t need any academic or historical investigation to know he was real. That he is real. I’ve known him. Maybe you have too. Maybe like me, you see him every day on the news, in life, in the memory of personal experience. Sometimes he wears a badge, sometimes a suit. Sometimes he’s followed me on the street or leered at me on the train. When I was young I sometimes encountered him on the playground or in the school hallway, trying to lift up my skirt or grab some part of me. More than once I’ve loved him and forgiven him. Sometimes he’s the picture of everything all good and charming. Oftentimes he’s put in charge of things, more than just riverboats, like committees, laws—and bodies, usually black, brown, and female.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think now, this election year, he’s too close for comfort to being put in charge of the whole country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I dumped that treasury of American folklore because I was too angry and ashamed to see what else was in the folk history of the United States, what further ugliness my country’s mythology had to reveal. The book confirmed what I’ve always known about my country, and my place as a woman in it, but don’t often like to face. I can’t afford to ignore the truth and cost of such “treasure” anymore. Mike Fink is deserving of dumping. America needs the coinage of a new, transformative folklore.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I picture my mother at the helm of a boat somewhere in the thick of ocean. Floating behind the boat is a glacier, a compression of quiet grace. My mother has tied a thousand ancient ropes to the glacier and is pulling it through the water with the same conviction that I imagine Moses had when he parted the sea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-534" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-1024x681.jpg" alt="16286584359_778ff002ed_k" width="660" height="439" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-300x199.jpg 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k-768x510.jpg 768w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16286584359_778ff002ed_k.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For years, she has whispered her plan to us. Before they all melt, my mother wants to transport a glacier from Alaska to wherever my sister and I are living, so that we will have a secure source of water. To keep it from melting, she will coat the glacier in sawdust, as if sprinkling confectioner&#8217;s sugar on a slice of bundt cake. Then, she will chain it to a tugboat and tow it across the ocean, where it will finally be left in a dry pond or a desert&#8217;s scorched riverbed so that my sister and I will not die of thirst. We have always rolled our eyes to this idea. <em>Impossible,</em> we&#8217;ve said. But, recently, I&#8217;ve wondered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the night of her seventieth birthday, my mother told my sister and I that some scientists believe the moon was once part of the earth. This theory surmises that when the moon separated from the earth, the Pacific Ocean was formed in its void. We were eating pineapple-upside-down cake in the flicker of candlelight, she was wearing a white kimono and a halo made from fourteen carmine flowers, and my sister and I balked at the idea. But my mother insisted until my sister googled it. <em>It&#8217;s called the fission hypothesis,</em> my sister says. <em>I guess I have to get a PhD,</em> my mother responded with a tilt of her halo,<em> for people to listen to me.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over a decade ago, my mother had a theory that the energy from the moving bodies at gyms or playgrounds could be used for electricity. When she and I walked past fitness centers with treadmills in the windows, she pointed to the sweating bodies and said,<em> Imagine how many light bulbs they could be powering?</em> My eyes went from the runners&#8217; wet, mangled hair to the ceiling, where fluorescent lights hummed incessantly above their heads, but I wasn&#8217;t convinced. Years later, my sister saw an advertisement: a company was utilizing the velocity of playing children to power electrical outlets in a playground.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maybe I’m wrong to not believe that you can part the sea, that a body can run enough to flash on a light bulb, that the moon can slice itself from the earth and spiral out into the knitted black of the sky. Maybe I am wrong to not picture the glacier, hulking and glossy, rising over the sea like a skyscraper; to not look closely at this image until I can see my mother&#8217;s reflection in the ice, waving at the distant sight of land, her salty seaweed hair swept into the sea-wind, rough waves smacking against the sides of the boat. If I look even closer, I will discern on my mother&#8217;s face not only the knowledge that her family&#8217;s thirst will forever be quenched, but also that now, after all these years, they will maybe, finally, believe her.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When my sisters and I were young, my dad used to sit one of us on his lap and thump on our back and chant “Hurley-burley, thumpety whack! Pretty good fellow, pretty good back! How many fingers do I hold up?” He would pause for us to guess a number, then resume the chant. “Two, she said, and three there were. Pretty good fellow to go to the war!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nobody I’ve talked to knows where this rhyme comes from—maybe it’s about sending child soldiers to war, or about the arbitrary nature of death. Often, those people tried to look  at simple nursery rhymes and try to find dark or scary origins for them. But most nursery rhymes, I’ve found, weren’t even created for children—they were the jumbled together songs and poems that tired mothers brought into the nursery, searching for anything to soothe a crying child. In fact, most nursery rhymes probably don’t mean anything, although one of the few that might have dark origins is “London Bridge is Falling Down.” Archeological evidence supports the claim that “London Bridge” is about human sacrifice—specifically, the practice of burying children in the foundations of a bridge to keep it standing. Though there are no findings of human remains in the current-day London Bridge, other old bridges have been found with human remains. Many of us have played the children’s game that goes with the song—two kids form an arch with their arms which falls to catch one of the others passing underneath. Maybe that “caught” person represents the victim of superstitious bridge-builders of the past.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But does the fact that this familiar chant might be about child sacrifice mean I shouldn’t tell it to my children one day? Or that I shouldn’t pass down my father’s rhyme? No, I think it means I should. Nobody knows what my father’s untraceable chant or “London Bridge” or “Ring Around the Rosie” are really about, but the world is still as dangerous a place as it was back then. We can make up our own stories as we go along, but the origins we give them today will be no better than the ones they might really have. Human nature hasn’t improved over the centuries. Old stories about children with candles who were killed to protect an ancient bridge aren’t fooling anyone that we’re better off today—not even our kids.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am four when she first appears to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trembling and afraid, I lie in ICU, other children dying around me. My parents sob silently. A mournful priest murmurs the last rites to someone in the room next to us, separated only by a thin curtain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My seizures have brought me here, to this place between life and death, and I feel my soul lingering in the hazy realm between worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-476" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1.jpg" alt="-1" width="1043" height="607" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1.jpg 1043w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-300x175.jpg 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-768x447.jpg 768w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/1-1024x596.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1043px) 100vw, 1043px" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I lie in the hospital bed, the mattress firm and cold, a shadow dances across the curtains. I feel a hand—a caressing breeze—stroke my hair. I can’t see her, but I <i>feel</i> her. Ancient, like trees rooted in centuries. She smells of earth after rain, and birds outside raise their choral hymn in honor of her. She whispers, her voice, maternally soothing, “Everything is okay. This is who you are, and you always will be.” She then disappears as a brush of wind trickles through the window.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The doctors come in with the verdict. “Epilepsy,” they tell me, “a seizure disorder. Idiopathic—no one knows how it’s caused.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My parents leave the hospital, wondering why I was “cursed to have this disorder, this—this <i>disease</i>.” <i>I</i> leave the hospital feeling blessed. As tired and scared as I was, I now feel at peace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over time, I discover that I’m not alone, that epilepsy has long been associated with spirituality, wiring our brains to the belief in the mystical. [1] Our brains become conduits, neurons sparking our sensations to perceive the otherworldly amidst the mundane. Believing in magic, my mother raised me on myths of fairies and ghosts, shadowy nature spirits that drift between worlds. I’ve always believed in these spirits, but epilepsy allows me to sense them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eventually, my seizures are controlled with heavy doses of anti-epileptic medication, pentagonal, powder-white pills labeled<em> Lamictal</em>. And through the passing years, the epileptic sparks in my brain cease to light.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“You no longer have seizures,” my neurologist proclaims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I feel a loss of identity at his words, my sense of self, melting into nothingness. What am I without my seizures? Without everything I’ve experienced? Without everything I’ve seen?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, my soul remembers that realm, that place between life and death, and she still visits me, wandering through the shadows when the air is damp with rain, when the creosote breathes its gentle perfume, and when the mist clings to the crevices of the mountains. She comes when the sky is darkened with magic and storms, and she whispers, “This is who you are, and you always will be.”</p>

<p><strong>A note for readers: the links below lead to many places, including articles describing physical and sexual violence. </strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a woman and you are curious, <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0312.html#perrault">grief is not far behind</a>. Your thirst will be quenched for a moment, yes, but then consequences will limp-lope toward you like an injured man (and isn’t that the world’s most dangerous creature, <a href="https://mic.com/articles/135394/14-women-were-brutally-attacked-for-rejecting-men-why-arent-we-talking-about-it">an injured man</a>?) and you will regret all of your choices. And if you are a woman and you age, <a href="http://lithub.com/on-the-invisibility-of-middle-aged-women/">you will be invisible</a> and <a href="https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2015/07/03/ok-cupid-data-on-sex-desirability-and-age/">no one will want you</a>, but if you <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/28/cosmetic-surgery-normal-acceptable-face-womanhood">tighten, lift, tweak, cut, suck, pack, polish, paint, or conceal</a>, then vanity is your weakness and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=jny1r-mrensC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=%22the+old+woman+who+was+skinned%22+suffer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig7KfI-rvNAhUK1B4KHWNnAMYQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20old%20woman%20who%20was%20skinned%22%20suffer&amp;f=false">you deserve what comes to you</a>. And if you are a woman, <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0306.html#grimm">your pleasure is a problem</a> <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/slut-shaming-bullying-women">that needs solving</a>. And if you are a woman and someone needs a bartering chip, you are that bartering chip. You can be <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20160618_Bucks_man_arrested_after_12_girls_found_in_his_home__including_2_he_fathered_with_a_14-year-old__police_say.html">bought and sold</a>, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/nigerias-stolen-girls">taken without consequence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal">passed around</a>, <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm012.html">bound against your will</a>. Your worth, to them, falls somewhere between organic greens and <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/09/22/vyckie_garrison_on_escaping_quiverfull.html">broodmare</a>—an object to be consumed, fucked, acted upon. Do you see the pattern, now? And if you are a woman and you promise something to man or beast, that promise is <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm001.html">eternal and binding</a>. You might think <a href="http://www.bustle.com/articles/141289-7-things-that-can-be-rape-even-if-you-were-taught-to-think-that-they-cant">your mind is yours to change</a>, but you would be mistaken.
