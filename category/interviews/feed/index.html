<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Kate Bernheimer is an American fairy-tale writer, scholar, and editor. She has been called “one of the living masters of the fairy tale” (Tin House). Her work includes the story collections </em>Horse, Flower, Bird<em> and </em>How a Mother Weaned Her Girl from Fairy Tales<em> and she&#8217;s the editor of four anthologies, including the bestselling </em>My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me: Forty New Fairy Tales<em>. Bernheimer’s work as an author, critic, and professor explores the intersections of contemporary fairy tales with multiple disciplines; she constantly pushes her students to think beyond conventional thought and heighten their creativity on fiction prompts. Bernheimer teaches fiction workshops and fairy tale classes at the University of Arizona.<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What inspired you to begin to write? Why did you focus on fairy tales?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I fell in love with reading as a young child. I would read anything &#8212; fairy-tale books, novels, toothpaste boxes, Mr. Coffee instructions, comic books, detective stories, Hollywood magazines. I began writing fairy tales when I learned how to type, in Kindergarten, first by playing around on my grandfather&#8217;s IBM Selectric. Fairy tales were my first love as a reader, so I guess that&#8217;s where I began, and I just never stopped.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Your book </b><b><i>Horse, Flower, Bird </i></b><b>was such a delectable and tangible read. The stories are charming, strange, and even beautiful. I remember reading it in one of my early literature courses and I thought the entire collection was poignant. It’s a fairy tale book, but some consider it as prose poems. Would you agree?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b> </b>Oh, this is so kind of you to say! These are just the words I would hope for someone to use about that little collection. I consider these short stories to be fairy tales, but contemporary prose poetry, by my reading, borrows a huge amount of techniques from fairy tales so I can absolutely see why some readers might think that. I read a great deal of poetry, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-738"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Did you read fairy tales as you were coming of age? Did any stand out for you and help shape your work?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did read fairy tales as a child &#8212; I read Golden Book versions, big hardcovers with gold lettering on the spine, scholarly collections like Edith Hamilton&#8217;s <em>Mythology</em>, tons and tons of them. By osmosis all of them shaped my work, by way of shaping my imagination &#8212; its aesthetic grammar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>As an aspiring fiction writer myself, I’ve noticed the difficulties that come along with trying to craft and master our own unique voice. What advice would you give to writers who don’t feel comfortable with their own work or who are afraid to write?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The difficulties you notice are not those of an aspiring fiction writer, but of a fiction writer: so good work! Being afraid to write can be cured one of two ways: by deciding not to write, or by deciding to, and making the time to, write. I would advise choosing one or the other. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I am not often comfortable with my own work &#8212; unless I am doing it, and then sometimes, the discomfort falls away and I am fully in my imagination and comfortable there, even if I am writing about uncomfortable things. A willingness to be uncomfortable is important &#8212; if you don&#8217;t know what makes you uncomfortable, how can you respond to it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What is your writing process like? Is there a specific routine you have to do to be able to write or do you approach the writing process in a whole different manner?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My process is not that mysterious: I decide when in a day I have time to write, and that&#8217;s when I do it. That&#8217;s the whole routine, in a nutshell. Sometimes I have more time, and sometimes less, sometimes the work goes well, and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Have you been currently working on anything?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>Tin House</i></b><b> has mentioned and named you “one of the living masters of the fairy tale.” What are your thoughts on this?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I consider myself the master of nothing, so I think it is hilarious and also flattering and sort of horrifying all at the very same time. But yes, I have definitely dedicated my life to fairy tales as an artist, and the <em>Tin House</em> quote makes me feel the work has been appreciated, which means a great deal to any artist, as we work so often in solitude without recognition. By &#8220;recognition&#8221; I mean merely that it makes me feel that the work might mean something to someone which is no guarantee.</p>

A native of southern California, Vivanco earned her BFA with honors in 1995 from the Laguna College of Art and Design in Laguna Beach and has exhibited her work in galleries across the U.S. Vivanco’s pieces have featured in art shows with themes ranging from old school video games to </i>Alice Through the Looking Glass<i> to ghosts of Halloween past. She has also illustrated editions of Hans Christian Andersen’s </i>Thumbelina<i> and the Grimms’ </i>Snow-White and Rose-Red<i>. The narratives and characters of her original paintings, meanwhile, are just as compelling as those of classic fairy tales. In Vivanco’s paintings, children with enigmatic expressions navigate wondrous, secret spaces and interact with animals depicted in ways both otherworldly and familiar. A crack in a tree provides the perfect place for hiding marbles, a wombat sips from a can of soda pop, a pair of candy-striped frogs study a map in a forest, a bee feeds off plants growing out of a boy’s hat, and another tree grows cushions on its limbs for the comfort of a daydreaming girl and cat. I interviewed Vivanco to find out about the world she creates in her work and her inspirations.</i></p>
<p><b>Let’s begin by talking about your influences and what kind of things inspire your art. How would you describe your paintings to someone who’s never seen them?</b></p>
<p>I would say figurative&#8211;but not photo realistic. Sort of story-book&#8211;but not specific stories. Whimsical at times. Colorful. Quietly fantastical. I never feel like I have the description just right!</p>
<p><b>Do you aim to tell a story with each of paintings? Do you have a specific narrative in mind as you start on a piece? How does a painting of yours typically develop?</b></p>
<p>I don’t aim to tell a specific story. Rather than a narrative I go for the character. I keep sketchbooks of rough ideas and use my sketches to prompt me forward on a blank panel. I don’t like to overdevelop an idea or details before I get started because then the piece would feel “spooled out” already, like it had already lost its energy. The painting develops on the panel first with a rough formation with vine charcoal (easy to wipe off with a rag), then a tighter graphite drawing and then washes of colors. I tend to outline with darker colors, but not always. Areas get filled with color then washed and textured with other colors, details are added and glazes are built up. I use acrylic colors and mediums, so I don’t have to wait too long to build up layers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_678" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-678" style="width: 312px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cushiontree.jpg"><img class="wp-image-678" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cushiontree-300x300.jpg" width="312" height="312" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cushiontree-300x300.jpg 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cushiontree-150x150.jpg 150w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cushiontree.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-678" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Cushion Tree&#8221;</figcaption></figure>
<p><b>You’ve created paintings for recent editions of Hans Christian Andersen’s “Thumbelina” and the Grimms’ “Snow-White and Rose-Red.” What drew you to those stories? How different is it to create based on set narratives, like a classic fairy tale, versus making up your own narrative (if any) as you go? Do you feel you have to stick to any specific parameters or limitations when you paint “on commission” or according to a set narrative?</b><span id="more-670"></span></p>
<p>It is definitely more difficult to stick to a story when painting multiple pieces. The Snow White and Rose Red and Thumbelina books were done for specific publishers and they gave me a lot of freedom but it still felt limiting to stick to the story, keep the costumes consistent and paint the same characters over and over. Plus these are stories that people are familiar with, so there are loaded expectations and that makes it harder to be free creatively. Same with painting commissions. Even if there is free reign and “no expectations” I feel pressure to paint something the patron will like. I don’t mind too much though as I tend to like the finished pieces quite a bit. Commissions push me in a way, but the feeling isn’t quite the same as when I paint whatever I feel like at the time.</p>
<p><b>Like many fairy tales, all your paintings feature children or animals, or both. But remarkably, sentimentality isn’t a quality of your work. Instead, your paintings are imbued with mystery, wonder, independence and curiosity, depth of emotion, and sometimes even darker themes like fear, danger, or loneliness. How do you keep the sentimental out of your work? Have your paintings been viewed by children as well as adults? If so, is there any difference in the reaction?</b></p>
<p>That is nice to hear! I don’t like overly sentimental or saccharine art, so I try not to fall into that…pastiche? I do hold a seed of a feeling and treat the figures in my work like they have their own motivations and feelings. I hope this comes through to the viewer. Reactions are varied based off of the individual viewer’s experience and everyone has their own interpretation of the narratives they believe the work has. Younger viewers tend more to interpret an adventure or relationship narrative, especially if there are animals in the painting. Adults key more into the inner dialog they pick up in the “characters,” or they see themselves or their siblings. I have painted so many unintentional “sisters” or “daughters”!</p>
<figure id="attachment_677" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-677" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blanketfort.jpg"><img class="wp-image-677 size-medium" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blanketfort-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blanketfort-300x300.jpg 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blanketfort-150x150.jpg 150w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blanketfort.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-677" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Blanket Fort&#8221;</figcaption></figure>
<p><b>I’ve read you collect vintage children’s books. What are some of your treasures? Any fairy tales or fantasy books? What else do you collect?</b></p>
<p>I love everything from Richard Scarry and Nancy Drew to the old school fairy books. I have vintage Black Beauty and Snow White, Raggedy Ann, Mother Goose, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Halloween stories, and Wallace Tripp illustrated books. The internet makes it so much easier to find and collect images from books I would never have a chance to see in person, like mid-century Russian illustrations.</p>
<p>I have a large collection of old photographs as well. I have been finding and buying them from antique stores and flea markets since I was a teenager. Sometimes a person in one of these old photos will inspire a whole painting just with the look in their eye.</p>
<p><b>What is your favorite fairy tale or folktale and why?</b></p>
<p>I have read so many that they start to run together with so many quests and beasts and curses but The Brothers Grimm tale of The Juniper Tree sticks with me. It’s perfectly gruesome and has the requisite evil stepmother!</p>
<figure id="attachment_679" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-679" style="width: 233px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/directions.jpg"><img class="wp-image-679 " src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/directions-225x300.jpg" width="233" height="311" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/directions-225x300.jpg 225w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/directions.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-679" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Directions&#8221;</figcaption></figure>
<p><b>If you had to give a name to the world you create in your paintings, what would it be?</b></p>
<p>In C.S. Lewis’ book “The Magician’s Nephew” there is a place that is lush green and so peaceful that you can hear the plants growing. The “wood between worlds” is strewn with pools that go to different worlds. I have always loved the idea of that place so something like that would be perfect.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ram_Devineni.jpg"><img class="wp-image-601 aligncenter" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ram_Devineni-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="249" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ram_Devineni-300x169.jpg 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ram_Devineni-768x432.jpg 768w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ram_Devineni-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" /></a><i>Ram Devineni is a filmmaker, publisher, and the founder of </i><a href="http://www.rattapallax.com"><i>Rattapallax</i></a><i> films and magazine. His films include the documentaries </i>The Human Tower (2012)<i> and </i>The Russian Woodpecker (2015)<i>,</i> <i>which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. Devineni is also the creator of </i><a href="http://www.priyashakti.com">Priya’s Shakti</a><i>, an augmented-reality comic book series featuring a superhero who fights gender-based violence in India. </i>Priya’s Shakti<i> was inspired by the gang rape and death in New Delhi in 2012 of a young woman returning home on a bus at night after seeing a movie with a male friend. The crime sparked protests across India as well as conversations about gender-based violence, patriarchy, and victim-blaming. In </i>Priya’s Shakti<i>, Priya is a young woman attacked by a group of men who finds her power (shakti) to help other survivors with the aid of the Hindu god and goddess Shiva and Parvati and a tiger companion. In the comic’s sequel, </i>Priya’s Mirror<i>, Priya uses a mirror to free a group of acid attack survivors held prisoner by an acid-green demon-king, Ahankar, who himself has become imprisoned by toxic masculinity. In addition to rich and colorful illustrations and mythological characters, the comics feature augmented-reality technology that brings to life the stories and voices of real women who’ve survived gender-based violence. Intrigued by this extraordinary project, I contacted Devineni to find out more about the Hindu, Indian, and mythological elements of the Priya series.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Why did you decide to create this comic series? There seem to be many different people and groups involved. Can you describe their different roles and contributions?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although I am the creator of this project, I really consider this a team effort. Everyone played a valuable part in the creation of the comic book and project. I met [artist] Dan Goldman at a StoryCode Meetup in New York City, and [we] hit it off on the spot. I think he signed on the next day. Dan is a remarkable artist and philosopher&#8211;he has brought a new perspective and look to the Hindu gods. His design is based on deep respect and affection for Hindu mythology and the power of the image. Each page is a stand-alone painting that can be mounted in a gallery. [Producer] Lina [Srivastava] has vast experience creating social impact strategies for documentary films and art projects. She has been instrumental in developing partnerships with major NGOs. She recently set up a partnership between the project and Apne Aap Women Worldwide&#8211;one of India’s leading NGOs supporting at-risk girls and women by ensuring them access to their rights, and to deter the purchase of sex through policy and social change. Vikas K. Menon co-wrote “Priya’s Shakti” and Paromita Vohra co-wrote “Priya’s Mirror.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the backstory of how the comic book started:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was in Delhi when the horrible gang rape happened on the bus in 2012, and was involved [in] the protests that soon followed. Like many people, I was horrified by what had happened and angered by the indifference exhibited by government authorities at every level. There was an enormous outcry in particular from young adults and teenagers&#8211;both women and men. At one of the protests, my colleague and I spoke to a Delhi police officer and asked him for his opinion on what had happened on the bus. Basically the officer’s response was that “no good girl walks home at night.” Implying that she probably deserved it, or at least provoked the attack. I knew then that the problem of sexual violence in India was not a legal issue; rather it was a cultural problem. A cultural shift had to happen, especially views towards the role of women in modern society. Deep-rooted patriarchal views needed to be challenged.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For about a year, I traveled around India and Southeast Asia learning from poets, philosophers, activists, and sociologists working for NGOs focused on gender-based violence. Talking with several rape survivors, I realized how difficult it was for them to seek justice and how much their lives were constantly under threat after they reported the crime. Their family, local community, and even the police discouraged them from pursuing criminal action against their attackers. The burden of shame was placed on the victim and not the perpetrators. This created a level of impunity among men to commit more rapes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-599"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>How do the Priya comics reflect traditional Hindu and Indian beliefs and legends? How do they challenge them?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted to use constructs that already exist in India and also use popular mythological stories to address this problem. I began researching Hindu mythology and discovered the many rich stories involving regular people and the gods. Often a favorite disciple would call on the gods for help during dire situations. So, I began formulating a new mythological tale where a mortal woman and rape survivor would seek help from the Goddess Parvati&#8211;only after she had nowhere else to turn. Although Lord Shiva and other gods get involved, eventually it is up to her to challenge people’s perceptions. I wanted to create a new Indian “superhero”&#8211;Priya, who is a rape survivor, and through the power of persuasion she is able to motivate people to change. Priya is the catalyst for change. Not the gods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion, the core essence of Hinduism is about conquering your fears. In the story, Priya confronts the tiger that has been stalking her. She turns her fear, the tiger, into her power&#8211;her shakti. Also mythology is the story of us. In Hindu mythology, Parvati is the goddess that challenges Shiva, the other gods, and humans to open their eyes to sensitivity and struggles of others. For her, wisdom is meaningless if it does not enable the liberation of those who are trapped in fear. So, her role is to challenge Priya to conquer her fears, but it is up to Priya to motivate and challenge other humans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Is Priya a more assertive character than most female Indian and Hindu characters or is she typical? Was her character inspired by film and other comic book heroines or by mythological heroines?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Priya is influenced by my interviews with rape survivors, but on a mythological level, she is an alternative representation of the Goddess Durga. Durga is the ultimate goddess of feminine power and empowerment, and she rides a tiger. We subverted that image by putting a rape survivor (Priya) on a tiger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priya2.png"><img class=" wp-image-606 aligncenter" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priya2-300x275.png" alt="priya2" width="457" height="419" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priya2-300x275.png 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priya2-768x704.png 768w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priya2-1024x938.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px" /></a><b></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Why are there gods and goddesses (Shiva and Parvati) as characters in these stories? Were they included to bring a higher moral authority to the comics? Or just to make a more colorful story?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Hindu gods have an important meaning in the comic book. Shiva is removed from human society, and is deep in meditation. At first he is unable to empathize with the sufferings of humans, but it is through Parvati that he changes from an “insensitive angry god into Shankara, the god who empathizes and is patient” (<a href="http://devdutt.com/books/7-secrets-of-shiva.html">Devdutt Pattanaik’s “The Seven Secrets of Shiva”</a>). Shiva eventually believes that the human race can change, and allows Parvati to instill “shakti” into Priya, who then becomes the catalyst for change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, the Goddess Parvati is the awakening light in Priya and Shiva; the Goddess wants Shiva and the human race to empathize with Priya and other survivors of rape. She motivates Priya to conquer her fears and find her shakti and be the catalyst for change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Devdutt Pattanaik’s book “The Seven Secrets of Shiva,” he writes: “That is why the Goddess stands in opposition of Shiva as both the radiant Gauri, producing light, and as the dark Kali, consuming light…She hopes to change Shiva the insensitive angry god into Shankara, the god who empathizes and is patient.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>“Priya’s Mirror” focuses more on men’s responsibilities in fighting gender-based violence than “Priya’s Shakti.” Can you talk about the demon-king character, Ahankar? Is he based on anyone in Indian mythology? How did his character develop?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahankar is an unusual and complex villain. He is born of acid and is a victim too. He is given a boon by Lord Shiva to either purify the acid he was forced to drink or make it more potent and dangerous. Unfortunately he chooses the latter. He feels he is a benevolent and caring King by hiding women who have survived acid attacks in his castle and away from the real world. He does not realize that by doing this, he is actually entrapping them in their fears and depression. We wanted to a show a male character who is also a victim of patriarchy. Patriarchy and indifference affects everyone. There is no direct influence in creating Ahankar, but characters like him are common motifs in Hindu mythology. A classical example is the demon-king Ravana in the Hindu epic Ramayana.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>“Priya’s Mirror” also includes the stories of women other than Priya who have survived acts of gender-based violence, namely acid attacks. I think this is an interesting element because so many fairy tale and folklore collections have involved asking local people in a community to contribute their own experiences or stories passed down in their families. How were these women’s stories collected for “Priya’s Mirror”?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last December 2015 I was in Delhi presenting the comic book at the Delhi Comic Con, and I had the chance to meet Sonia [Chowdhary] and Laxmi [Agarwal] with Stop Acid Attacks in their office. What I discovered after talking with them is that they faced the same cultural stigmas and reactions from society that rape survivors had to endure. How society treated them intensified the problem and their recovery. How they were treated by their family, neighbors, and society determined what they did next. Often they were treated like the villains and the blame was put on them. Our comic book focuses on this and tries to changes people’s perceptions of these heroic women. The comic book’s main character is Priya who is a survivor of gang rape and we wanted to continue her movement and adventures and by focusing on acid-attacks allowed her story and character to evolve. The correlations were too obvious and imperative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I spoke with Sonia and Laxmi with Stop Acid Attacks in December 2015 and later with Monica Singh with the Mahendra Singh Foundation and Natalia in Colombia with Natalia Ponce de León Foundation. They all helped to create the characters and story. Here are their short videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Onj3hAimP8">Sonia</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CawlbbYRT4I">Monica</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RDpOzmzne0">Laxmi</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OemhDkgBBo">Natalia</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priyas_mirrors_heroes.jpg"><img class="wp-image-610 aligncenter" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priyas_mirrors_heroes-300x141.jpg" alt="priyas_mirrors_heroes" width="528" height="248" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priyas_mirrors_heroes-300x141.jpg 300w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priyas_mirrors_heroes-768x361.jpg 768w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/priyas_mirrors_heroes-1024x482.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What is in the future for Priya? Any more stories in the series? Is there any chance Priya’s adventures will make the leap from augmented reality to TV or film in the future?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next chapter is about sex trafficking, and we are working with Apne Aap Women Worldwide to develop the story. Dan and I were in Kolkata [in November] and interviewed exploited women in the red light areas. The story will be co-written with Emmy Award winner and advocate and founder of Apne Aap, Ruchira Gupta. The research is funded by the Jerome Foundation and we hope to release it in a year. We are looking into doing an animated short film, but financially it’s super expensive and we feel we get more impact continuing the comic book series.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Last, what is your favorite Hindu or Indian fairy tale or folk tale and why?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a kid, I always loved the story of Ganesha. He is a fun and adorable deity whose story really resonates with kids. Also he is the god of good fortune, so all Hindus pray to him.</p>

Sonya currently lives in Seattle with their cat, Magpie Underfoot, and a growing collection of taxidermy, wet specimens, and other oddities. </em>Salt Is For Curing<em> (Sator Press, 2015) is their full-length debut — a poetry collection about bones, dill, and survival. Sonya&#8217;s poems, essays, and interviews have appeared in </em>Entropy, Lodown, The Hairpin, VIDA, The Poetry Foundation,<em> and other publications, and their chapbook </em>My Heart In Aspic<em> is available from Porkbelly Press. They hold a BA in Linguistics with minors in German Linguistics and Finnish from the University of Washington.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983243735"><em>Salt is for Curing</em></a> is a dark and delicious book. Your poetry is teeming with folklore and food, evoking a hunger that simmers in magic. Blood, bones, vegetables, herbs mingle with robbers, wolves, Baba Yaga, Ivan the Fool. There is bread and there are potions. Ripe plums and Koschei the Deathless. You’ve said “There’s not really a divide between folklore and my… sense of self — at least the stories I had told to me as a child, and that’s usually what I’m referencing in poetry.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Which figure from Russian fairy tales did you most identify with as a child? In whom do you see yourself now? Did you connect more deeply with male or female characters as a child, and has that changed?</strong></p>
<p>The one I felt pulled to was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koschei">Koschei Bessmertniy</a>, though not in an identifying type of way — more like I wanted to be his lover or flunky or something. I never ever cast myself as a hero, and I can’t decide if that’s because I was a timid child or because I had such a strong sense of ego that I disliked role-playing as someone other than myself. Maybe both. “Male-adjacent” is a good way of describing how I connected with characters, though. I internalized gender roles enough to know I couldn’t be Koschei, but you’d never find me in Baba Yaga’s camp either. I was really intimidated by female characters. Baba Yaga scared the shit out of me, to the point where I didn’t even like her as a folktale figure, whereas Koschei was bae.</p>
<p><span id="more-560"></span></p>
<p><strong>Before your move to the United States, did you read primarily Russian tales? And after? What difference of texture did you perceive between Russian stories and the Western European stories favored in American popular culture?</strong></p>
<p>I had multiple books anthologizing stories from all over the world, and honestly I’m not sure I really got the distinction between Russian culture and non-Russian culture ‘til after I moved. I read the Brothers Grimm, and a bunch of English tales about giants and people named Jack, and it all felt about the same to me, possibly because it was all translated by the same people. The biggest difference I remember noticing was reading level — going from these giant novels in Russian to second grade reading materials that had, like, five words on a page. That was really confusing. I’d say my first two years here were basically just really confusing.</p>
<p><strong>What difference is there in reading, say, Grimm or Andersen stories in the Russian language versus reading those same stories in English? What do you feel is lost in translation when one reads Russian tales in English language editions?</strong></p>
<p>Well, Russian translators tended to take more liberties with stuff like plot and character names, but mostly I think the gist was about the same — and when you’re talking about Grimm and Andersen, or even Charles Perrault or whatever, those are individual authors who wrote specific versions of a folk story. That wasn’t really my experience with Russian tales. I mean, I read Pushkin, of course, but mostly I discovered Russian mythology through my mother and grandmother telling me stories. Like, I would say “Mama, tell me a new one about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_dragon">Zmei Gorinoch</a>,” and she would make something up. It was a very non-canonical approach.</p>
<p><strong>If you were to invite your favorite Russian fairy tale characters over to your place for herring and vodka, what would that party be like?</strong></p>
<p>As a child, I had a habit of climbing under the dining table and falling asleep during parties… I’m not much better as an adult, honestly. There’s a really famous animated Russian adaptation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bremen_Town_Musicians_(film)">Musicians of Bremen</a>, and that’s probably the party I’d like to go to.</p>
<p><strong>You have a tattoo of Baba Yaga’s chicken-legged hut. Do you have other Russian and/or fairy tale skin art? </strong></p>
<p>My very first tattoo, from when I was eighteen or nineteen, is of Koschei’s needle-in-an-egg — I have a bunch of beets on my left thigh, too, and some aspic on my calf. They’re very comfortable and reassuring images, for me. They make my skin feel like a home.</p>
<p><strong>Baba Yaga is a creature of ambiguity. She is dark and frightening, but she can be interpreted as a force of nurture as well as nature. She is a monster of complexities and nuance. Without a doubt, Baba Yaga has become familiar to many Americans in recent years. Versions of her appear in video games, an animated movie, novels, comic books. Is there an adaptation of Baba Yaga that you feel is particularly authentic or true to her essence?</strong></p>
<p>There’s a Baba Yaga episode in the Canadian show Lost Girl that I’m partial to — mostly because Kenzi is one of my favorite TV characters ever. I wish that show had been around when I was younger; I don’t remember there ever being Russian characters on TV, let alone snarky goth ones.</p>
<p><strong>Spirits in Russian folklore tend toward the dangerous, the seductive. Rusalki, leshiye, the vodyanoi; it seems that everything out in those birches wants to confuse you, lead you astray, drown you, strangle you&#8230; Even the spirits of field and home require placating in exchange for their benevolence. Those o</strong><strong>fferings most often come in the form of food, of course. Your poetry is richly flavored by this distinctively Slavic sense of both darkness and hunger. Food is married fast to myth and magic in your work. Does that convergence often happen in your own kitchen?</strong></p>
<p>My cooking is not very magical, unfortunately. Whenever my mother would make piroshky, she would be really irritable, and this didn’t make sense until I started making them regularly myself — there’s this final step where you’re turning the dough over in a hot pan, and it’s too soft to use a utensil, and too small to use gloves, so you’re touching hot dough with your fingers for about half an hour and snapping at everyone around you. That feels very Russian to me: sour and bossy and no-nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>Could you share a recipe for what you consider the consummate Russian fairy tale dish?</strong></p>
<p>I co-wrote a borscht recipe once with fellow Russian poet Gala Mukomolova, <a href="http://darkfuckingwizard.com/i-know-the-truth-forget-all-other-truths/">which you can find here</a>. Like fairytales, most of my recipes are handed down from my mother and have vague measurements and also funny typos like “red paper” and “flower.” I’ll give you another beet recipe as an exclusive — this is my father’s recipe for vinegret salad:</p>
<p><em>A few (4) large red, yellow, or white potatoes (NO Russets!)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Two large carrots</em></li>
<li><em>One large beet</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Place in a large stock pot and boil. Let cool. In the meantime, dice finely:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>One large white onion</em></li>
<li><em>A jar of brined pickles</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Defrost a bag of frozen petite green peas. Optional if you like beans: one can of small beans. (Father Vatomsky recommends zesty S&amp;W beans.)</em></p>
<p><em>Peel cooled vegetables and dice all of them. Dices should be about the size of a pea. Mix it all in a large bowl. Add vinegar. (Father Vatomsky</em> <em>recommends</em> <em>white</em> <em>balsamic vinegar from TJ’s; I prefer regular distilled.) Add vegetable oil. Taste as you go.</em></p>
<p><em>The rule: if you taste as you go, it is very difficult to put too much oil or vinegar. Or black pepper.</em></p>
<p><em>Only add salt at the very end if you think you need it. Pickles should have enough. Also, have another jar of pickles just in case. There is hardly ever too much pickles.</em></p>
<p><em>Option: use ½ pickles and ½ sauerkraut but this is a debatable move.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>In 2014, when I began studying fairy tales, I came across Pauline Greenhill&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/41388863?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">&#8220;&#8216;Fitcher&#8217;s [Queer] Bird&#8217;: A Fairy-Tale Heroine and Her Avatars,&#8221;</a>  an academic article that offers a queer reading of <a href="http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/bluebeard/stories/fitchersbird.html">&#8220;Fitcher&#8217;s Bird,&#8221;</a> my favorite Grimm fairy tale. The article has deeply influenced my thinking and writing on fairy tales and so I was thrilled when, after sending off an email to Greenhill, she agreed to an interview.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Greenhill is Professor of Women’s and Gender Studies at the University of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Her most recent book is </em>Screening Justice: Canadian Crime Films, Culture and Society<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> which was co-edited with Steven Kohm and Sonia Bookman, and published in 2016.

She has fairy-tale research published in </em>Feral Feminisms; Law, Culture and the Humanities; Marvels &amp; Tales; Narrative Culture; Studies in European Cinema; <em>and </em>Theoretical Criminology<em> among others.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>There&#8217;s a storied tradition of studying fairy tales through a feminist lens, but you take that work further, examining queerness in fairy tales. How did you find your way into this field of research?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Absolutely my queer/trans research is an extension of my feminist research! But my route to queer and trans fairy tales was circuitous. I started a masters in Folklore at Memorial University in St. John’s, Newfoundland in 1977. At the time, and to a sad extent now, the cool kids avoided traditionally recognised forms of folklore like ballads and fairy tales. Trying to be one of them, I did my masters thesis on family photography.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, when I got to the University of Texas at Austin in 1981, where I did my PhD, I worked with Roger deV. Renwick, a ballad and folk song scholar who has always been an advocate for studying traditional genres (see e.g. Renwick 1980 and 2009). So for my PhD dissertation on folk poetry in Ontario under Roger’s supervision, I was looking for the old in the new, as it were (Greenhill 1989).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After five years teaching Canadian Studies at the University of Waterloo, I came to the University of Winnipeg’s (then) Women’s Studies program in 1991. (We’re now a Department with six full time faculty and we’ve included “and Gender.”) At the time I was working on Newfoundland ballads about women who dress as men to follow their lovers or seek adventure as sailors, soldiers, or robbers. You can listen to one example <a href="http://tidido.com/a35184374041547/al55f091c6a5f39075733cc084/t55f091c7a5f39075733cc127">here</a>, sung by the fabulous Newfoundland traditional source singer Anita Best on the compilation album <i>Bristol’s Hope&#8211;Lately Come Over</i>. Hitherto folklorists’ readings assumed that these songs were about men and their experiences, and my feminist reading asserted that they were also about women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-540"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, when I talked to my undergraduate feminist theory class, telling them my idea that these songs expressed possibilities for women to control their own libidinal and reproductive economy (that is, to choose their own sex partners/husbands rather than having the partner chosen by their father as is most common in ballads), the students pointed out alternatives to my heteronormative interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Specifically, I didn’t take into account the fact that these songs often circled around the drama of a man declaring love for and/or suggesting sex with the cross dresser, apparently thinking she was male; or a woman declaring love and/or suggesting sex, unaware that she was attracted to a woman. Following the students’ lead, my first queering of traditional culture ventured that these ballads were (also) about same-sex attraction (Greenhill 1995). I have since continued to queer, and later to explore transgender expression in, traditional ballads (Greenhill 2014).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fairy tales entered the mix when I invited my friend, colleague, and co-conspirator in feminist and queer folklore Kay Turner to teach an intensive feminist folklore course at the University of Winnipeg in 1997. Kay decided to offer a few classes on the Grimms’ fairy tales, and again our fabulous Women’s Studies students were influential! They read the stories anew, reflecting upon them from their own queer locations. Kay and I were fascinated and resolved to do a book incorporating these interpretations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Transgressive Tales: Queering the Grimms </i>(Turner and Greenhill 2012) was 15 years in the making. Part of the problem was the difficulty of finding folklorists in the late 1990s who were willing to venture a queer reading of traditional fairy tales! Then, just as we were getting ready to finalise our plans, 9/11 happened. Kay was working as the folklorist for the Brooklyn Arts Council and turned all her attention toward documenting and recording people’s personal and aesthetic responses. By the middle of the decade, I was despairing of our chances of ever getting the book going, so I submitted my paper on “Fitcher’s (Queer) Bird” (ATU 311) to <i>Marvels &amp; Tales</i>, and they accepted it (2008).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, Kay and I resolved that we had to complete that transgressing! We proposed <i>Transgressive Tales </i>to Wayne State University Press’s Series in Fairy Tale Studies and they accepted. With a combination of work from seasoned scholars and from students, we looked at some literary rewritings, but also at traditional stories. For my own contribution, I managed to sneak in a Canadian fairy tale&#8211;“Peg Bearskin” in Newfoundland and “La Poiluse” in Francophone northern Ontario&#8211;about a gutsy, masculine-looking and -acting young woman who saves her sisters, seeks adventures and impossible tasks, and eventually marries a prince and magically transforms (herself) into a more feminine presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you think reading these archetypal stories through a queer lens is important?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I like to use the insights of film theorist Alexander Doty on “queering” cinema, because they apply to nearly everything else also. The concept of queering too often “implies taking a thing that is straight and doing something to it” (2000, 2). Doty points out that heterosexual readings are conventionally presumed to be intrinsic, where queer and trans readings, then, must necessarily be taking an already-straight text and rendering it queer&#8211;an additive process, a reading-into, a twisting. Doty disagrees with that perspective, and so do I. We presume that texts have no essential sex, gender, or sexuality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certainly a lot of fairy tales look superficially straight (especially as redacted by those who bring their Christian, heteronormative perspectives, like the Brothers Grimm). Many focus on heterosexual marriage&#8211;either as an ending for men or as the beginning of women’s troubles! (discussed by Holbek 1987). However, sometimes one can be absolutely flabbergasted by how close to the surface queerness is; a lot of fairy tales really work well to undermine heteronormative presumptions. To quote Lewis Seifert, one of the first American scholars to start outing fairy tales, in his introduction to the recent special issue of <i>Marvels &amp; Tales</i>, called “Queer(ing) Fairy Tales,” a lot of times we find “erotic innuendo hiding in plain sight” (2015, 17)&#8211;and, I would add, queer and trans content similarly hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How could I NOT have seen the gay/lesbian/trans elements in those cross-dressing ballads? Because everything I’d learned growing up straight, and being intellectually formed in the discipline of folklore in the 1970s and 1980s, taught me to simply gloss over them! How can we NOT see a fairy tale type called “The Shift of Sex” (ATU 514), in which a woman transforms into man, as being about transgender expression (Greenhill and Anderson-Grégoire 2014)? What’s NOT queer about a story about a boy born half human, half hedgehog, who rides off on his shod cock (Greenhill 2014a)? Why should pointing out lesbian elements in a story like Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Snow Queen”&#8211;like Little Robber Girl kissing and sleeping with Gerda, so thoroughly overplayed especially in male directors’ live action films of the tale (Greenhill 2015)&#8211;seem anything other than obvious? In part because we’re taught that fairy tales are for kids, who are of course (wrongly!) presumed to be sexuality-free, its queer/trans content (presumed X-rated) seems invisible/impossible! And because, as Doty pointed out, the presumption that everyone and everything is always heterosexual prevails. But once you start looking&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your favorite fairy tale and why?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> I confess to being a bit fickle in my fairy-tale loves. When I was working on “Fitcher’s Bird,” I was smitten. Then “Peg Bearskin/La Poiluse” called me, and “The Shift of Sex,” and “Hans My Hedgehog” (ATU 411). Lately in my fairy-tale film research I’ve branched out to include literary fairy tales, and I was watching and writing about cinema based on Andersen’s “The Snow Queen.” I was fascinated by the differences I saw between male directors’ readings of the story and the sexualities involved, and those of four (feminist) women directors (Greenhill 2016).</p>
<p>But the only fairy tale I actually tell&#8211;teaching is my usual performance&#8211;is a version of “The Robber Bridegroom” (ATU 955). I first heard it told by The Folktellers at the <a href="http://winnipegfolkfestival.ca/folk-fest/">Winnipeg Folk Festival</a>, a long time ago. There’s so much to love in that story. It’s a thriller&#8211;the story-within-a-story that the hero/ine uses to save themself; the triple incremental repetition “Be bold!” “Be bold, be bold!” “Be bold, be bold, but not so bold, lest that your heart’s blood should run cold.” I so appreciate the horror moments in fairy tales&#8211;especially when, as in “Fitcher’s Bird,” “Peg Bearskin,” “The Shift of Sex,” and of course “The Robber Bridegroom,” the sister, usually the younger sister, like me, eventually prevails.</p>
<p><strong>What have you been working on recently?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My colleagues Jill Terry Rudy, Naomi Hamer, Lauren Bosc and I are co-editing the<i> Routledge Companion to Fairy-Tale Cultures and Media</i>. I’ve promised a monograph called <i>Species of Magic and Wonder: Transgender, Transbiology, and Transformation in Fairy-Tale Media </i>to the Wayne State University Press Series in Fairy-Tale Studies. My colleagues Martin Lovelace, Anita Best and I are doing <i>“The Maid in the Thick of the Well”: Gender and the Magic Tales of Alice Lannon and Pius Power Senior</i>, a book on the ten magic tales collected from two Newfoundland source tellers. I’ve applied for a grant to do more on justice issues and fairy-tale media with Canadian and international colleagues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://iftf.uwinnipeg.ca/">The International Fairy-Tale Filmography online</a> needs constant updating. And I want to do more on two films: <i>Celestial Clockwork </i>(directed by Fina Torres, 1995), a lesbian/gay/queer transnational version of “Cinderella” (ATU 510A) about a Venezuelan mezzo-soprano in Paris trying to get the lead role in a film of Rossini’s <i>La Cenerentola</i>; and<i> The Fall</i> (directed by Tarsem Singh, 2006), another story-in-story story which explores storytelling and is visually amazing, having been filmed in more than 20 countries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m hoping to do more participant-observation on film sites with the fabulous women from <a href="http://www.redczarina.com/">Red Czarina</a>. Director Danishka Esterhazy welcomed a student research assistant and me to the set of <a href="http://www.hg-movie.com/"><i>H &amp; G </i></a>, a “Hansel and Gretel” (ATU 327A) film centring on Winnipeg and the surrounding countryside. It was a fantastic experience to see a movie being made. Danishka is in post-production on <i>The Singing Bones</i>, based on Francesca Lia Block’s “Beauty and the Beast” (ATU 425C) short story called “Bones.” Rebecca Gibson will be directing “Jane Garbage,” a modern “Cinderella” story. And check out Danishka’s earlier fairy tale films, <a href="http://www.danishkaesterhazy.com/portfolio/the-snow-queen/"><i>The Snow Queen </i></a>and <a href="http://www.danishkaesterhazy.com/portfolio/the-red-hood/">The Red Hood</a>&#8211;a riff on “Little Red Riding Hood” (ATU 333).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So much has been done on film since Sidney Eve Matrix and I did <i>Fairy Tale Films: Visions of Ambiguity </i>(2010) and Jack Zipes’s <i>The Enchanted Screen: The Unknown History of Fairy Tale Films </i>(2011) came out. (I have to give a shout out to Jack who has been an amazing supporter, mentor, and collaborator.  Thanks, Jack!) And many new fairy-tale films have come out, which I’m dying to share with the wonderful Women’s and Gender Studies students&#8211;and of course all the other students&#8211;at the University of Winnipeg. I’m hoping to teach a fairy-tale film course in Fall 2017 and screen some films I’ve encountered recently as well as some old favourites. My students loved <i>The Wolves of Kromer </i>(directed by Will Gould, 1998), a sweet film using “Little Red Riding Hood” to reflect on homophobia. And of course, all the cool new theory and analysis, including Anne Duggan’s (2013) work on Jacques Demy’s fairy tale films and Cristina Bacchilega’s (2013) de-colonising reflection on the transnational fairy tale web.</p>

<p><em>Aaron Mahnke is the writer, host, and producer of <a href="http://www.lorepodcast.com/">Lore</a>, a podcast about true life scary stories. When he&#8217;s not working on Lore, Mahnke writes <a href="http://aaronmahnke.com/novels/">supernatural thrillers</a>. He lives with his family in the historic Boston area, in the very heart of Lovecraft Country and the epicenter of the Salem witch trials. You can follow him <a href="http://www.twitter.com/amahnke" target="_blank">here</a> on Twitter, and learn more about him on his <a href="http://www.aaronmahnke.com" target="_blank">website</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>I chatted with Mahnke about the similarities between fairy tales and horror, and the relationship between folklore and history.</em></p>
<p><strong>Can you start by talking a bit about LORE? Why did you decide to make the podcast? What got you interested in the history behind folklore, horror and ghost stories?</strong></p>
<p>Lore is a podcast that digs into the darker side of history, uncovering the roots of common folklore and superstition, and exposing some of the more unbelievable motivations and actions of people throughout history. It’s a storytelling podcast, sort of like a fire-side chat, where I tell stories about what happened, and then try to ponder why.</p>
<p>Lore began as a happy accident. In an effort to grow my book sales into something that could justify the time I spent actually writing them, I tried writing a series of non-fiction essays on my five favorite New England folktales and legends. My goal was to give that away as an incentive to people willing to sign up on my fiction email list. But the project got a bit too long, and so I decided to try converting it to audio.</p>
</div>
<p><span id="more-388"></span></p>
<p>After a friend heard the first essay, he convinced me to skip the mailing list plan and publish it as a public podcast. The rest is history, I suppose!</p>
<p>My interests are in history, the unexplainable, and cultural anthropology. I love digging into the reasons behind things we believe or do, and have found that the true historical events behind a lot of our common superstitions and folklore have just as much entertainment value (or more) than the fiction we create. The truth can be frightening.</p>
<div>
<p><b>Horror and fairy tales have a lot in common&#8211;like horror, traditional fairy tales tend to be gruesome and violent. Motifs from fairy tales (like enchanted woods and werewolves) sometimes show up on episodes of the podcast. Do fairy tale inspire your work on LORE?</b></p>
<p>Fairy tales are super violent. The stories we grew up on, for the most part, are white-washed, purified versions of the originals. Red-Riding Hood gets eaten by the big bad wolf in the original — after being fed her grandmother’s blood and flesh, mind you — and the woodsman literally has to cut open the wolf to pull her out. It’s a modern horror film to the core.</p>
<p>I’m not sure that fairy tales inspire Lore, but they certainly become the topic for episodes from time to time. Some fairy tales are vessels that hold true events (like the Pied Piper), while others are old tales used to teach a moral or truth. Lore isn’t 100% built on fairy tales, but they are a big part of it.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>I loved the episode where you recounted the history behind the Pied Piper folk tale (<a href="http://www.lorepodcast.com/episodes/24">Episode 24, &#8220;A Stranger Among Us&#8221;</a>). I&#8217;ve wondered about the roots of the Pied Piper legend, and was fascinated by what the episode turned up. How did you come across this history?</strong></p>
<p>How I stumble on to these things is sort of a mixture of accident and stubbornness. I usually read something interesting in one article and then chase it down in other sources to see what might be known. For the Pied Piper history, the wiki page was a great jumping point because it mentions many theories and a common consensus among historians. From there, it’s easy to dig deeper.</p>
<p><strong>In that episode, you talk about how the legend of the Pied Piper was created to explain away a dark historical event: the selling of Hamlin&#8217;s children to locators of the Holy Roman Empire by the townspeople. These locators were looking for people to settle newly conquered land in present-day Poland and, instead of agreeing to go themselves, many towns and villages relinquished their children, instead. Have you come across other examples of folk and fairy tales masking unsavory history?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe not so blatantly, but there are many examples of “edited history”, where the story we read is just part of a larger story. Yes, the <a href="http://www.lorepodcast.com/episodes/episode-3-the-beast-within">werewolf of Bedburg</a> ravaged the village and surrounding area, but in the end, the villagers ravaged him. The victor writes the history, you know?</p>

<p><em>I lived in Appalachia for four years, and it&#8217;s there that I encountered&#8211;and fell in love with&#8211;Appalachian ballad singing. Sparse and haunting, ballads are usually sung without instrumentation and tell melancholy tales of betrayal and lost love. Many draw on traditional literature&#8211;like folklore and fairy tales&#8211;and the medieval romance tradition. I wanted to know more, so I asked my friend <a href="http://www.sarosings.com/">Saro Lynch-Thomason</a>, a folklorist and ballad singer, a few questions.</em></p>
<p><em>Lynch-Thomason&#8211;who is based in Asheville, North Carolina&#8211;is also an illustrator, author, and social activist. In 2012 she completed </em><a href="http://www.blairpathways.com/">Blair Pathways: A Musical Exploration of America’s Largest Labor Uprising</a><em>&#8211;a researched compilation of over 20 historic songs from West Virginia’s labor wars. Saro has led the Asheville Community Sing since 2010 and regularly teaches regional ballad workshops, Wassailing choruses, and May Day choruses on social justice themes. In 2013, Saro completed her solo CD </em><a href="https://sarolyncht.bandcamp.com/album/vessel">Vessel</a><em>&#8211;an acappella compilation of ballads and songs from Appalachia and the British Isles. Her distinct, powerful singing style transports audiences to Appalachian mountain hollers, 19th-century coal camps and old meeting houses.</em></p>
<p>(As a heads up, this interview mentions sexual assault.)</p>
<p><strong>Ballad singing traveled from the British Isles to Appalachia, where you live. Can you tell me a little bit about ballad singing, how it originated and how it ended up in the U.S. Mountain South?</strong></p>
<p>Ballads as they are often referred to today reference a particular story-song form that has been in Europe for nearly 1,000 years. Often a ballad involves first or third person narration, a simple rhyme scheme and a repeated melody. In the 1100s and 1200s, this form of storytelling was popular across what is modern-day France and Spain. A class of minstrels, supported by nobility, traveled and composed poetry and songs in this format. Over 2,000 poems have survived from this period, along with hundreds of melodies.</p>
<p>Since then there have been several periods of songwriting popularity, during which everyone from nobles to peasants took an interest in creating and singing their own ballads. Many ballads were written in the Middle Ages, about 300 of which survive today. But many ballads come from a revival period that began in the 1600s and had its heyday with the creation of the letterpress. People wrote and dispersed songs across Europe and America, drawing on old melodies and themes but with updated characters and political messaging.</p>
<p>During this period many ballads came to America, brought by immigrants from England, Ireland, and Scotland who arrived throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Immigrants families carried and adapted these songs for generations as they worked and settled across the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, the Piedmont in North Carolina, and the Appalachian Mountains. These song styles became dispersed into Afro-Appalachian communities as well, where people continued to change them.</p>
<p><span id="more-355"></span></p>
<p><strong>How did you become interested in ballads? What has your journey studying, singing and teaching ballads been like?</strong></p>
<p>Growing up in Nashville, TN, my parents played music from the British folk revival of the 60s and 70s alongside contemporary composers who drew from traditional sources&#8211;singers like Sinead O’Connor and Loreena McKennitt. I latched on to the ballads I heard and spent time by myself memorizing them. In addition, my aunts had learned many ballads in the folk revival era, and taught me songs from their repertoire.</p>
<p>When I attended college in the Northeast I met other people my age who studied and sang ballads. Having peers who were just as interested in these songs as I was encouraged me to learn more. After school I moved to Western North Carolina to connect with the many traditional singing communities there, and I’ve been studying ballads ever since.</p>
<p>The process of hearing a ballad, learning it, and teaching it has always felt very emotional and spiritual to me. Knowing that a song has been carried from body to body for generations is a powerful thing. A song has to really resonate with many people in order for it to be passed and remembered and cherished for long periods of time. When I sing a ballad, I feel like I’m not only inheriting the song but the community of people who have sung it. I have an invisible circle of folks who affirm my feelings and connection to the song’s content. Getting to teach these songs to others, and learning what the stories mean to them, is a rewarding and revelatory experience.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of stories do ballads tell? How do ballads relate to traditional forms of literature, like folk and fairy tales?</strong></p>
<p>Ballads can tell just about every kind of story. They’ve been used to spread news, to teach moral lessons, as political propaganda, as escapist fantasies, and as fatalistic laments. Since these story songs have been around since at least the 1100s, it’s impossible to generalize what they tell about. Different eras do seem to have had favored themes, though. In America, for example, popular ballad themes have included murders (often based on real events), cowboy tales, betrayed love, and train wrecks. In the 1600s and 1700s in England many ballads detailed the dramas of the nobility (sort of like modern-day tabloids), lamented sailors’ deaths at sea, and celebrated famous battles.</p>
<p>For as long as these songs have been around they’ve enjoyed a close relationship with literature. Starting in the same period that medieval minstrelsy was popular across Europe&#8211;the 1100s&#8211; there was a literary form popular among nobility called romance writing. Nobles and aristocracy would write stories inspired by legends and older histories, using prose and verse forms. Over time people truncated these stories, added a tune, and started singing them. In turn, these ballads could eventually inspire new poetry or novels.</p>
<p>A great example of the interweaving of literary and musical storytelling can be seen in the Thomas of Erceldoune legend. Thomas of Erceldoune was a Scottish lord in the 1200s. According to legend, he was a seer and prophet, and is also credited with writing the English version of the romance “Tristram and Isolde”- a precursor to the Lancelot and Guinevere legend. Erceldoune passed away in the late 1200s, and about one hundred years later someone decided to write a romance praising his abilities. The narrative is written from Thomas’ perspective, and explains that he received his gifts of prophecy from a fairy queen. By the 1700s, this romance had become a ballad. The first verse of many versions says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">True Thomas lay on Huntlie bank,<br />
A ferlie he spied wi’ his ee,<br />
And there he saw a lady bright,<br />
Come riding down by the Eildon Tree.</p>
<p>Thomas spies a “ferlie” with his “ee,” or “eye. In the Scots language a “ferlie” is a “wonder,” in this case the wondrous site of the fairy queen approaching Thomas to take him to her realm.</p>
<p>During the same period this song was popular, a literary ballad revival was taking place in Europe. Aristocratic scholars and writers began to collect and study ballads, using them as inspiration for poetry. One of these artists, Sir Walter Scott, collected the Thomas ballad and wrote his own third part to the narrative, extending the story and reviving interest in the singing of the ballad.</p>
<p>The song seems to have made its way to America, and was written down in the mid-1900s from a version sung by a woman named Becky Gordon in Western North Carolina. Her first verse reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">True Thomas lay on yonder hill<br />
And saw a lady gay<br />
A lady that was bright and fair<br />
Come riding down the way</p>
<p>I found this ballad in a collection of North Carolina folklore and added my own tune since it had none. I’ve been singing it for a few years now. To me, it’s a “ferlie” that a story like True Thomas has been around for so long, and I think its survival and popularity is due to the fact that it has taken literary forms many times.</p>
<p>Some people argue that if a ballad is written down, it begins to die&#8211;that putting the narrative to paper means people will stop knowing it and holding it in their minds and memory. I think the history of Thomas of Erceldoune demonstrates that the relationship between written stories and sung stories is natural and mutually beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>You’re interested in the sociopolitical dimensions of ballad singing. How does your work with ballads – as well as the ballads themselves&#8211; relate to issues like feminism, economic justice, and environmental destruction in Appalachia?</strong></p>
<p>Ballads have a powerful political dimension to them&#8211;they can be used to push against cultural expectations or to affirm them. Which meaning a ballad has is often up to the interpretation of the singers and listeners.</p>
<p>I’ve been teaching workshops for a while that focus on women’s experiences in ballads. Some of the stories in ballads are about the hardest experiences women go through&#8211;like economic disenfranchisement, abortion and sexual assault. In some ballads women face these challenges and find creative solutions to overcome them, and in others they simply have to bear the weight of these traumas. In my workshops, I’ve been exploring how these kinds of stories can be viewed as empowering in the right context. For example, a song that I’ve enjoyed singing to myself for years is called simply “Queen Jane.” The ballad is about a rape, and I’ve sung it to myself, alone, countless times as a way to emotionally process my experiences of sexual assault. It’s such an intense song that I would have trouble hearing or sharing it in a public space, but the solitary practice of singing it has been a great comfort to me. Whoever originally wrote “Queen Jane” may not have had that use in mind for the song, but that’s how ballads work&#8211;the songs survive because they take on personal meanings to people. This use of ballads as processing tools for traumatic experiences is profound and moving to me as a feminist and activist.</p>
<p>As an organizer in Appalachia, I’ve enjoyed using ballads as overtly political statements. A lot of European songs from hundreds of years ago speak to the same issues Appalachians are facing today, including <a href="http://content.sierraclub.org/coal/mining-destroying-mountains">environmental destruction </a>and lack of access to land. English ballads about the enclosure of the commons could easily describe <a href="http://auroralights.org/map_project/theme.php?theme=coal_river_101&amp;article=14">the modern state of private land ownership</a> in Appalachia. Some of these older songs also tell about rebellions and land reclamation movements, suggesting strategies that could be used today.</p>
<p>One of my favorite political ballads is an adaptation of an English song called &#8220;The Cutty Wren.” The song is thought to have originally been a coded rebel song about killing the king and dispersing his riches. One of the characters in the song declares, “We’ll shoot the cutty wren!” &#8212; the wren being a longtime symbol of kings and rulers. In the new version, adapted by ballad singer and Appalachian activist Michael Kline, the song details the plans of a group of people to blow up a bulldozer on a strip site. The same character declares, “We’ll blow the big dozer!”</p>
<p>Appalachians have taken older songs like this and countless times adapted them to their own struggles. Like all ballad singing, whether the song ends sadly or hopefully it serves the purpose of connecting many generations and helping the singer move through their own struggles. It’s an empowering and affirming tool that I hope continues for at least another thousand years.</p>

<p><em>I  first encountered Michael Mejia&#8217;s short story &#8220;Coyote Takes Us Home&#8221; last year, while reading Kate Bernheimer and Carmen Giménez Smith&#8217;s anthology </em><a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/306136/my-mother-she-killed-me-my-father-he-ate-me-by-edited-by-kate-bernheimer/9780143117841/">My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me</a><em>. As a story based on Mexican folktales that addresses the U.S.-Mexico border, it stands out in an anthology that&#8211;while excellent&#8211;mostly draws upon European lore. Mejia carved out time in his busy schedule (he teaches creative writing at the University of Utah, is the Editor-in-chief of </em><a href="http://ourworld.info/whrweb/">Western Humanities Review</a><em>, the co-founding editor of <a href="http://www.ninebarkpress.org/">Ninebark Press</a>, and the author of the novel </em><a href="http://www.fc2.org/authors/mejia/forget/forgetfulness.html">Forgetfulness</a><em>) to talk to me about &#8220;Coyote Takes Us Home,&#8221; the fraught landscape of the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, and the trips he took south of the border in an effort to learn about his Mexican heritage.</em></p>
<p><strong>I live near the U.S.-Mexican border&#8211;in Tucson, Arizona&#8211;and I encountered your story, &#8220;Coyote Takes Us Home,&#8221; while writing about borderland fairy tales and folklore for the <i>Fairy Tale Review</i> blog. Why did you decide to write a newfangled fairy tale about crossing the border?</strong></p>
<p>As with any good fairy tale, there are three knocks required to open this question.</p>
<p>The first reveals an answer you may already know. In my note following &#8220;Coyote Takes Us Home<i>,&#8221;</i> I mention having half-heard, some years ago, a news report about unaccompanied minors stowed in cars crossing the border, in a way we might expect with shipments of drugs. It&#8217;s fantastic, of course, and dangerous, and absurd, and real. Parents leave their children with relatives, come to the U.S., work to pay for the kids&#8217; care, eventually putting aside enough to have them sent north, through a network of strangers, and smuggled across the border. Sometimes the parents will be forced to pay thousands of dollars more, a ransom, to have the kids delivered as much as 2000 miles away, to North Carolina or Pennsylvania, Washington or Chicago. Or the kids might get caught along the way and repatriated to a shelter on the Mexican side of the border. A phone call or a fax from their parents, a promise to send them home, to not to try again, can be enough to get them released, and that night they&#8217;ll be back in the Arizona desert.</p>
<p>The story got even more desperate in 2014, when more than 40,000 kids from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala (far more than from Mexico) were fleeing gang violence and recruitment as well as poverty. They came walking, riding buses, and riding the tops of trains across multiple borders on their way north, with no family at all in the US.  Aside from finding these stories terrifying and sad—though if…when…the kids do make it across, I think we know there&#8217;s a real chance at something like a happy ending—I wanted to consider the issues of abandoning your home place, the socio-economic pressures that would make that place unlivable, the unexpected uprooting that occurs on that morning word comes that you&#8217;re to get in the car, on the bus, and the loss of cultural knowledge this journey represents. Which brings me to the second knock.</p>
<p><span id="more-329"></span></p>
<p>This one reveals that &#8220;Coyote&#8221; emerged from another project, a book of nonfiction I was researching at the time, about my family&#8217;s roots in Mexico. I&#8217;d been traveling there—to Jalisco first, to Guadalajara and Tequila—where my grandmother was born, where my great-grandfather was a tequila taster around the turn of the twentieth century—but also to Guanajuato, San Miguel de Allende, Querétaro, and Mexico City, about once a year from 2006 to 2009. I&#8217;d developed a desire, maybe a need, to better understand my Mexicanness, to find a way to value it, to embrace it as I hadn&#8217;t so much when I was younger. On the first trip, I knew no Spanish. That was deliberate. I needed to work for my reward. (One might also read this as self-punishment. I was raised Catholic, and oh, how I admire the bloodied and broken bodies of indigenous-made Christs.) I started teaching myself after the first trip and was eventually able to sustain some basic conversation.</p>
<p>That spring before I first visited Tequila, I&#8217;d planned to spend some time interviewing my father about his childhood in Texas, where he was born, and his own sense of his heritage, and my grandmother about her youth and her emigration in 1924. I&#8217;d recorded her telling me that story, and the story of my father&#8217;s father—who he never knew—about ten years earlier, but by 2006 I felt greater urgency to fill out those briefly-sketched tales and to explore my reasons for wanting to better identify the Mexican in me.</p>
<p>Then my father and my grandmother both died, within about a month of each other, before I&#8217;d had a chance to ask for more. All I had to go on was the tape, with all its questions and gaps. Between my trips to Mexico, I sat down with cousins, aunts, and my uncle for interviews. The project, obviously, was very openly personal, unusual for me, and I kind of stalled out, finally, a little overwhelmed by my research, and uncomfortable with the various starts I&#8217;d made to piece it together into a book. I could construct a narrative of our history, but I wasn&#8217;t sure yet how I wanted to represent it or talk about it.</p>
<p>Kate Bernheimer and Carmen Giménez-Smith&#8217;s invitation to contribute an updated fairy tale to <i>My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me</i> showed up in my inbox at that exact moment, a magic key. I&#8217;d written an essay on the tale of Bluebeard some years earlier for Kate&#8217;s <i>Brothers &amp; Beasts</i>, an anthology of men writing about fairy tales. I think my first impulse was to turn again to that story, but then, given what I&#8217;d been immersed in, I thought this was an opportunity to explore my Mexico through other means, through fiction, whose distance provided a fresh and less sentimental connection. Much of the imagery in &#8220;Coyote&#8221;—its street markets, its festivals, its bricolage of detritus and souvenirs and smells and flavors—was imported from my research trips to Mexico. The narrative&#8217;s concerns with cultural loss, figured in ruins and stories, in abandoned characters out of context, may be my attempt to imagine my grandmother&#8217;s experience as much as those of contemporary children.</p>
<p>So, the third knock.</p>
<p>Crossing the border, any border, with the aim of immigration, is a kind of fairy tale, a classic journey of danger and education. It requires guides, more or less honest, or you make the journey at your own peril. You go to the border to be reborn, to come out new on the other side, more free, more yourself, maybe, which means someone else.</p>
<p>This fairy tale—I mean this now not as something ephemeral, but, better, a dream that can become reality—was what my grandmother was after, what her cousin had achieved for himself in Texas and then California, before returning to Mexico to rescue her from a sugar plantation near Ameca, Jalisco, as he&#8217;d promised his mother before she died. His white horse was waiting on the edge of town for them, the cousin, my grandmother, her oldest daughter, her unborn child. That&#8217;s how my youngest aunt heard it from my grandmother before drifting to sleep in the moonlight. By then, the ugly details of my grandmother&#8217;s early marriage at 14, the physical and emotional abuse she suffered from her husband—an alcoholic who was later killed in a knife fight, who left her to beg for food while he ate well-enough with his parents—the burden of her alcoholic father, had been redacted. They left the husband behind, my grandmother told me. They lied about how they were related to avoid uncomfortable questions. My grandmother was her cousin&#8217;s sister. Her daughter was their younger sister. Do they live happily ever after? That&#8217;s a story for another time.</p>
<p><strong>In the note that follows your story, you mention that the folk tales you wove into &#8220;Coyote Takes Us Home&#8221; come from Jalisco, Mexico, where your grandmother was born. How did you first encounter these stories? Which of these traditional tales is your favorite?</strong></p>
<p>When I started &#8220;Coyote,&#8221; I knew nothing about Mexican fairy tales. (Why, oh why, do I always make things as hard as possible?) I knew something about Aztec myth, of course, but I understood that this wasn&#8217;t really the point of the anthology, and also that the Aztecs were just one group that had populated what became Mexico, particularly the central region, and that they weren&#8217;t really prominent in the west, where Jalisco is located. They weren&#8217;t my people.</p>
<p>Also, notice that I don&#8217;t use the term abuela when I refer to my grandmother. That&#8217;s not who she was to me. I&#8217;m trying to think of a time I actually heard anyone refer to her that way. She didn&#8217;t share stories of the old country with me or with her other grandchildren, so far as I know, the way we see in many memoirs of loving abuelitas and assimilation. Some say she loved Mexico. Some say she hated it. She did go back several times after a period of separation, but she was also happy to return home to America.</p>
<p>So I got on a university library website and did a search for Mexican fairy tales. Among other things, I turned up a 1943 volume published by The American Folklore Society called <i>Tales from Jalisco, Mexico</i>, edited by Howard True Wheeler. It&#8217;s a kind of Lomaxian project (Alan Lomax and his father John were both members of the society), in which Wheeler wandered the Jaliscan countryside, soliciting tales from the locals. The names of the storytellers, the Mexicans, were expunged. Wheeler only includes the name of the town nearest to where he heard the tale. &#8220;Few informants,&#8221; he writes in his brief introduction, &#8220;were able to read and write and, even from those, a very small percentage of purely literary tales was obtained. These literary tales I eliminated.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure why it was necessary to suppress the local literary style from the collection, but already this text seemed to speak directly to my interest in distance and cultural erasure. These were not obstacles for me to overcome. They were, they remain, the elements of my condition. Also, the tales are all printed in Spanish, rendered, according to Wheeler, as closely as possible in the &#8220;fine type of Castilian&#8221; spoken in Jalisco at the time. I couldn&#8217;t read them. I relied, instead, on the English précis that headed each tale, and, when necessary, did my best to decipher the Spanish. These tales, like the detritus mentioned before, are scattered throughout &#8220;Coyote,&#8221; each section mashing up bits and pieces of the central images, characters, and events from several tales. Throw a stone, you&#8217;ll hit one.</p>
<p>As I say in my note, I was interested in the way the stories seemed to illustrate the varied strata of Mexican history, from pre-Conquest, to the colonial period, to post-Independence. The first period is represented, in my mind, by the animal stories, featuring coyotes, alligators, rats, ants, serpents, chickens, bulls. These last, though—the chickens, the bulls, and other farm animals—indicate that the Spanish have already arrived. The second group consists of translations or variants of European classics, retaining their kings, princesses, and castles. &#8220;Blanca Nieve,&#8221; for example. I remember my father teasing me when I was a kid with the Spanish name for Snow White, pretending he&#8217;d lost his ability to speak English.</p>
<p>The last are my favorites, in which clever Indians and mestizo campesinos often get the upper hand over an aged, often drunk, and bumbling priestly class. I love their quality of derision and their vulgarity, powerful forms of resistance. These are characters I recognize from my own family as well as from some of my favorite encounters on my research trips. There&#8217;s a fated darkness to these stories, and a violent struggle against oppressive institutions. For the moment, the downtrodden gain the upper hand, and it&#8217;s hilarious. When the feather tossed in the air lands on the priest, it&#8217;s him who&#8217;s condemned to hell, not some individual in the congregation of campesinos he&#8217;s trying to frighten with the absurd exercise, the congregation that flees, that frees itself from the confines of the church, believing the devil is already on his way. Instantly, all the church&#8217;s lessons are turned on their head, revealing the persistence of an indigenous will that cannot be eradicated.</p>
<p>If I have one favorite among these tales, it&#8217;s probably &#8220;El Porquito,&#8221; in which a family has nothing of value but a pig they&#8217;re feeding until it shits fat, &#8220;cague cebito.&#8221; The hungry daughter sticks a candle in the pig&#8217;s ass to give the impression that the time has arrived, fooling her mother, and this leads not just to the pig&#8217;s premature slaughter, but to a series of events—involving the Virgin Mary, Saint Peter, talking roosters and turkeys, and a donkey&#8217;s ass appearing on someone&#8217;s forehead—that reveal traitorous streaks in both the mother and an orphan girl living with the family. The father, having missed out on the fresh carnitas while he was away, is served fried portions of the mother&#8217;s buttocks as a ruse. I love the commingling of the sacred and the profane here, the tale&#8217;s unpredictable turns, its bizarrerie, its low humor, the asses and shit that are worth gold in this context. It&#8217;s not a particularly pleasant story, I suppose, but I think it describes a kind of reality for the now-unknown teller about the nature of his poverty, and that of his predecessors, that needs hearing, a reality my characters in &#8220;Coyote&#8221; are quite familiar with themselves before they hit the road.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Coyote Takes Us Home&#8221; dwells in the tension between the fantastic and the violent. At one point in the story, the moon is making the child travelers posole and tortillas. &#8220;&#8216;But where is Yolanda? Where is Areli? What happened to Pancho and Enrique?'&#8221; the moon asks, to which the narrator thinks, &#8220;The truth is not so pretty.&#8221; Throughout the journey, kids riding in the Nova are turned to paper and stolen by birds, among other, more graphic fates. Why did you choose to weave fairy tales together with the violence that too often accompanies crossing the border? Do you think those fairy tales encourage the reader to think about that violence differently? How?</strong></p>
<p>Great question. I think, first, the violence in &#8220;Coyote&#8221; is representative of the violence we often encounter in fairy tales—though maybe it&#8217;s more widespread and constant here—and particularly in the tales of Jalisco on which I&#8217;ve drawn. But I&#8217;ve also worked to create a somewhat realistic backdrop against which this violence occurs, which I hope highlights the general lack of safety one accepts when traveling the routes Coyote&#8217;s Nova does. Disappearance and death are always possible. Hopefully the flatness of the collective narrator&#8217;s response to the gradual dissipation of the group communicates a kind of resignation, echoing a fatalism I sensed in the stories in Wheeler&#8217;s <i>Tales</i>, and that of ordinary Mexicans I met on my trips to Tequila, who reluctantly accept indefensible inequality and the corruption of their local institutions, but still manage to maintain substantial dignity as they attempt to work within the system. It&#8217;s not to say the kids Coyote&#8217;s transporting are resigned to die, more that their lives have trained them to manage their expectations and to value their continued existence as less fortunate others fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>Also I think there are at least two kinds of violence at the border. There&#8217;s the violence of the crossing, which can mean the self-abuse of a long walk across a killing desert—a funneling into the furnace created by stricter, post-9/11 U.S. border policies and more fences, more surveillance devices, more militarized American manpower—as well as the abusive treatment guides subject their charges to, abandoning them to the sun or cramming them to suffocating overcapacity into a car&#8217;s trunk or a box truck. And then there&#8217;s the related violence of the drug war, which got significantly worse during the time I was working on this story.</p>
<p>Set between or against these, of course, are the various American agencies authorized for border security—DHS, CBP, ICE, BEST, state and local police forces, et al.—and unauthorized vigilante groups who&#8217;ve charged themselves with filling perceived gaps and often have a violent and racist rhetoric of condemnation of immigrants and their home nations. It should also be acknowledged, however, that while there&#8217;ve been notable incidents of violence perpetrated by, and claims of abuse against, American law enforcement at the border, Border Patrol agents are most often the people who rescue immigrants from dying in the desert.</p>
<p>In 2009, while on a research trip to El Paso, I was warned repeatedly not to go to Juarez, just one bridge away from downtown, not a sister city so much as a conjoined twin, as is the case with most cities and towns on the border. The morning I landed, several bodies had been discovered in a shallow grave in the desert on the Mexican side. The grave was a kindness. That same year, a well-known hit man nicknamed &#8220;el Pozolero,&#8221; The Pozole Maker, was captured in Tijuana. He got this name for his trademark practice of dissolving murder victims in barrels of acid. Again, those disappearances were both expedient and generous compared to the humiliating public displays of heads and hanging corpses that seem to have become the norm more recently. In 2011, two days before the city&#8217;s renowned International Book Fair, three van-loads of bodies were left in a traffic circle near a central monument in Guadalajara, a message sent by a local gang allied with Sinaloa&#8217;s El Chapo to their rivals, the Zetas. Though conflict was on the rise there, Guadalajara had, until then, remained relatively immune to the cartel violence rampaging elsewhere around the country.</p>
<p>This brings me back to vulgarity and its significance in Mexican life. Certainly these examples and others are representative of a horrific extreme, but I think they arise from a shared language of abjection, black humor, and vulgarity—forms of resistance, as I&#8217;ve said, terms I&#8217;m using with some admiration—and perhaps also the surreal, that one finds in many venues and media in Mexico. Advertisements and packaging, in their way, are violent. Popular culture, television, and popular music are violent, those attacking brass sections accompanied by whirling clarinets, the exploding rockets a boy lights and releases from his bare, gunpowder-blackened hand. Violence is, I think, very much a part of Mexico, though I don&#8217;t really mean that to be a criticism. And I also don&#8217;t mean to overemphasize the idea because surely I&#8217;ve encountered plenty of quiet generosity and kindness during my visits as well, much more than violence, and my Coyote is, after all, a fairly beneficent guide, trying to provide some education to his kids as they prepare to leave home forever (the &#8220;home&#8221; in the story&#8217;s title is intentionally ambiguous), to give them something to remember about an important, maybe the most important, part of themselves. Maybe I&#8217;m inclined to think of violence in Mexico as an aspect of boldness and vitality instead, a self-consuming explosion of life, an embrace of the tenuous nature of any seeming stability. Municipal presidents and candidates for governor are assassinated. The wealthy are kidnapped and held for ransom. Maybe I&#8217;m not sure yet what I think about violence in Mexico, border-related or otherwise, only that I know it exists, abundantly, that one feels its nearness, the nearness of death, and that this is one way Mexico, my Mexico, reminds us to live. Everything is always at risk, so why not keep playing with the devil, who tends to be more of a jester or a sad sack than a Prince of Darkness, less so than the drug kingpin who you hope to never meet? Any dire situation might be turned back by a derisive laugh and a curse. Maybe it&#8217;s the last laugh, maybe not.</p>

For this interview, however, I decided to ask Machado about an older story&#8211; <a href="http://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/">&#8220;The Husband Stitch,&#8221;</a> published by </em>Granta<em> in October 2014, and inspired by a frightening children&#8217;s tale, urban legends, and the experience of being an awkward kid at Girl Scout Camp.</em></p>
<p><b>&#8220;The Husband Stitch,&#8221; is a variation on &#8220;The Green Ribbon,&#8221; a popular scary story (I remember it well from childhood!). How did you first encounter &#8220;The Green Ribbon&#8221;? Why did you decide to write your own version of it? </b></p>
<p>I first read “The Green Ribbon” in Alvin Schwartz’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Dark,_Dark_Room_and_Other_Scary_Stories"><i>In a Dark, Dark Room and Other Scary Stories</i></a>, a children’s book in the vein of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scary_Stories_to_Tell_in_the_Dark"><i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i></a> series. (Though with significantly less terrifying illustrations.) Anyway, <i>In a Dark, Dark Room</i> had a story called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3PIkV2anqk">The Green Ribbon</a>,” by which I was simultaneously repulsed and entranced. Of all the urban legend and folktale retellings in Schwartz’s oeuvre, that’s the one that stuck with me the most.</p>
<p>Later, when I was in graduate school, I was hanging out with friends when <i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i> came up in conversation. That series pretty much scared everyone in my generation, and each person in my group had a different story from it that’d scared the bejeesus out of them as kids.</p>
<p>My brain kept returning to “The Green Ribbon,” and it occurred to me that there are all kinds of interesting currents about gender running beneath that story’s deceptively simple ice. That summer, I sat down and wrote the first draft of “<a href="http://granta.com/The-Husband-Stitch/">The Husband Stitch</a>.” At the time, it was just a straight re-telling of the protagonist’s story from meeting her future husband to her head falling off; the metafictional elements and retellings of other urban legends came later in the editing process.</p>
<p><span id="more-305"></span></p>
<p><b>Themes of transgressive female desire and secret female knowledge are central to &#8220;The Husband Stitch.&#8221; The story is based on a scary folk tale, and weaves in references to other frightening stories and fairy tales. What do you think it is about fairy tales, folk tales and scary stories that make them such great devices for exploring these themes? </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kate Bernheimer has a wonderful essay, “<a href="http://www.katebernheimer.com/images/Fairy%20Tale%20is%20Form.pdf">Fairy Tale is Form, Form is Fairy Tale</a>,” in which she praises the “artistic dexterity” of the fairy tale and discusses a critical part of the form: flatness. She writes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 90px;">This absence of depth, this flatness, violates a technical rule writers are often taught in beginning writing classes: that a character’s psychological depth is crucial to a story. In a fairy tale, however, this flatness functions beautifully; it allows depth of response in the reader.</p>
<p>This syncs up very closely with my own experience: that an ostensibly flat fairy tale with minimalist, abstract prose permits a range of deep emotions in a capable reader. Plus, a writer adapting a fairy tale has infinite tools at her disposal; she can tweak some or all of the form’s elements, and perform any other number of techniques (modernization, reversal of point-of-view, blending with another story, etc.) into near-infinite variations. The fairy tale is simply an excellent foundation for its own interrogation.</p>
<p>But in addition to the flexibility of the flatness—and perhaps more importantly—there’s also the “fairy tale as mirror” factor. No one will deny that many fairy tales have their own demented, regressive logic and morality, particularly when it comes to issues of gender. Giambattista Basile&#8217;s “The Old Woman Who Was Skinned,” for example—the origin of my <i>Fairy Tale Review</i> story “<a href="http://fairytalereview.com/the-ochre-issue/">The Old Women Who Were Skinned</a>”—is about an old woman permitting herself to be literally skinned so that she might be beautiful as her fairy-transformed sister, with a “lesson” at the end about vanity. “<a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/frog.html#grimm1">The Frog King</a>” is deeply and uncritically rape-y. The Charles Perrault version of “<a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0312.html#perrault">Bluebeard</a>,” a story about abuse and femicide, has <i>two</i> terrible “morals”—</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><b>Moral:</b> Curiosity, in spite of its appeal, often leads to deep regret. To the displeasure of many a maiden, its enjoyment is short lived. Once satisfied, it ceases to exist, and always costs dearly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;"><b>Another moral:</b> Apply logic to this grim story, and you will ascertain that it took place many years ago. No husband of our age would be so terrible as to demand the impossible of his wife, nor would he be such a jealous malcontent. For, whatever the color of her husband&#8217;s beard, the wife of today will let him know who the master is.</p>
<p>—neither of which properly gets at the heart of the story’s true horror. In fact, they almost appear to deliberately, laughably miss the story’s monstrosity.</p>
<p>So it seems to me that these morals serve as powerful mirrors for women’s actual relationships with the world: how we are steeped in a culture of rape and violence and death; how, if we resist, we are punished; how, even if we punish ourselves, we are mocked and blamed. And these mirrors are not (just) historical, not vague and old-timey and how it used to be. They are mirrors of here, now, today.</p>
<p>The fairy tale usually plays this element straight, of course, but that makes them virtual playgrounds for feminist writers; all we have to do is pick a story up and turn it askance.</p>
<p><b>The motif of the green ribbon, coupled with the themes of transgressive desire and secret knowledge, reminded me of Angela Carter&#8217;s short story &#8220;The Bloody Chamber&#8221; (a variation on Bluebeard in which the protagonist is gifted a red ribbon by her betrothed—a ribbon that prefigures the way he wants to kill her). Are you familiar with this story? Has Angela Carter inspired your work? What other writers and storytellers have influenced you?</b></p>
<p>Ah, yes. “A choker of rubies, two inches wide, like an extraordinarily precious slit throat… the flashing crimson jewels… bright as arterial blood.” That image is so vivid and terrible and beautiful. I do love Angela Carter’s work very much, but I came to her a bit later that one might expect. My literary education was sort of fragmented and weird; it was almost entirely self-directed (neither of my parents were big readers; I didn’t major in literature in college) and thus contained large gaps that I’ve only recently amended.</p>
<p>For example, I once wrote a story that an entire workshop identified as heavily influenced by Shirley Jackson. At first, I was confused by this comment, because I hadn’t read a stitch of Shirley Jackson beyond “The Lottery” in high school. But what I later concluded was that I’d read a lot of writers who were influenced by Shirley Jackson; so I was getting her fragmented, filtered influence.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I have read and am obsessed with Angela Carter and Shirley Jackson both. Other writers who influence my work: Patricia Highsmith, Jane Bowles, Muriel Sparks, Kelly Link, Karen Russell, Yoko Ogawa, Kazuo Ishiguro, Gloria Naylor, Gabriel García Márquez, Nicholson Baker, Kevin Brockmeier, Michelle Huneven, Michel Faber, Joyce Carol Oates, Helen Oyeyemi, Ann Patchett, Virginia Woolf, Jeanette Winterson, Sarah Waters, Michael Chabon, Alissa Nutting, Andrea Barrett, Chris Adrian, Ray Bradbury… I could go on forever.</p>
<p><b>“The Husband Stitch” is peppered with instructions that tell the reader how to share the story out loud, should they want to do so. These instructions gesture at traditions of oral storytelling. Why did you decide to include these instructions? What do you think they bring to &#8220;The Husband Stitch&#8221;? </b></p>
<p>When I was a Girl Scout, we’d go on this annual autumn camping trip in the Pocono Mountains. I sort of loved and hated it—I hated how cold and dark it was. I hated bugs. I hated the latrine. But I was enamored with the campfire—telling stories around it, eating food cooked in it, throwing various objects into it to see how they burned. (My favorite: a half-filled Dixie cup, which immediately burned down to the water line. Then the wax on the exterior blistered, and the contents bubbled and boiled for what seemed like forever, burned off, and then the entire thing was consumed by the flames.)</p>
<p>I was a really weird kid, and didn’t get along with the girls my age. But I was a good storyteller—theatrical, dramatic, effusive—and I loved telling tales around the campfire. So the first time I read the <i>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</i> series—which included a story where a ghost’s question, “Who’s got my money? Whoooo? Whoooo?” is followed by instructions for the storyteller to grab someone and yell “YOU’VE GOT IT!”—I became obsessed with the idea of the story crossing over into the real world. Which I did, the next chance I got. It was exactly as fun and exciting as I’d imagined. (And, bonus, I got to make a fellow Girl Scout cry. An artist is born!)</p>
<p>So of course, as I was working on “The Husband Stitch,” I got the idea to fold in warped narrative instructions. It does all kinds of interesting work: breaks down the wall between the story and the reader, invokes a tradition of oral storytelling, reinforces the story’s danger as real and literal, enables further commentary on gender, and is also just plain fun.</p>
<p>After I published “The Husband Stitch,” I received a bit of fan mail in which the writer told me that they had read this passage:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 60px;">(If you are reading this story out loud, move aside the curtain to illustrate this final point to your listeners. It’ll be raining, I promise.)</p>
<p>And then felt compelled to push aside their living room curtain. And it was raining. And it blew their mind. Knowing that has happened <i>even once</i> fills me with incomprehensible amounts of joy.</p>
