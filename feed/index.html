								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In the two and a half years that I’ve been editing <em>Tiny Donkey</em>, I’ve never written about my favorite fairy tale. It’s a lesser known story from the Brothers Grimm (although, as fairy tale enthusiasts, you probably know it!) called <a href="http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/bluebeard/stories/fitchersbird.html">“Fitcher’s Bird,”</a> about a young heroine who outwits an evil sorcerer and saves her sisters in the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One thing I love about “Fitcher’s Bird”&#8211;something that <a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/2016/10/interview-pauline-greenhill/">Pauline Greenhill</a> writes about in <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/247490">“Fitcher’s [Queer] Bird: A Fairy-Tale Heroine and Her Avatars”</a>&#8211;is that the story doesn’t have a Disney-perfect ending. The heroine doesn’t marry a prince, inherit a kingdom, or even return to a simple-but-cozy cottage to live out the rest of her days. Instead, as Greenhill writes, “There is no happily-ever-after in ‘Fitcher’s Bird,’ the tale ends with the death of [femicidal sorcerer] Fitcher and his cronies. [Heroine] Fitcher’s Bird is last seen on the path from Fitcher’s house, speaking to the sorcerer, again a truly liminal location.” There’s something freeing about this ending and it’s refusal to be tied up in a happily-ever-after bow&#8211;something that allows for multiple possibilities and paths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we started <em>Tiny Donkey</em> in April 2015, it felt like we were beginning from that unknown place in the woods. With the blessing of <em>Fairy Tale Review’s</em> founding editor Kate Bernheimer and the help of then-prose editor Joel Hans, we started this journal with the question, “What is fairy-tale nonfiction?” Over the next two and a half years, we published fairy-tale-esque memoir, cultural criticism, academic analyses, and experimental prose in attempts to find answers. We accompanied this work with interviews of our favorite fairy-tale writers and thinkers, from <a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/2016/02/interview-carmen-maria-machado/">Carmen Maria Machado</a> to <a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/2016/05/interview-aaron-mahnke/">Aaron Mahnke</a> to <a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/2017/02/interview-kate-bernheimer/">Kate Bernheimer</a> herself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We still don’t have an answer to our query, but we have lots of ideas of what fairy-tale nonfiction can be. In so many ways, we’re still in the middle of that enchanted forest&#8211;except, instead of just a few of us editors, these woods are now crowded with our contributors and readers, our supporters and interviewees. It’s nice here&#8211;overgrown and full of chirping birds, scurrying animals, and unknown prospects and potentials.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And this, dear reader, is where we’ll leave you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re ending <em>Tiny Donkey</em> for one of those usual reasons: not enough capacity. Over the past few years we’ve all grown and changed as writers, editors, and humans, and other projects have started consuming our time and energy. For example:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Former editor Richard Leis continues to read, write, and submit poetry and fiction, and participates in workshops at the Writers Studio Tucson and the University of Arizona Poetry Center. Leis recently won the Writers Studio’s Write-to-Read award and read his poem <a href="https://richardleis.com/2017/10/23/appearance-wrap-up-room-a-literary-reading-at-antigone-books/">“These Are the Animals You May Eat”</a> at Tucson’s Antigone Books.</li>
<li>Editor Anna Lea Jancewicz’s short story collection <em>(m)otherhood</em> is forthcoming this autumn from Widow and Orphan House Press, and she continues her work as Editor-in-Chief of <em><a href="https://rabblelit.com/">Rabble Lit</a></em>, a journal of working class literature that you should definitely check out, if you haven’t already.</li>
<li>Editor René Ostberg has been writing but experiencing a year of full rejection.  On the plus side, she recently moved and now lives across the street from a river with a railroad tracks close by. She enjoys watching the river rise and recede from week to week and listening to the traffic and trains roll by at night – it brings comfort and perspective in distressing times. She might self-publish something called <em>Heartlandic</em> by year’s end – check in on her at <a href="https://reneostberg.com/">her website</a> for updates if you like.</li>
<li>Editorial assistant Gabriel A. Jiménez is at work on a collection of short stories, and will soon be applying to graduate programs. His long-term goal is to become a literature professor.</li>
<li>Editorial assistant Cat Solewin is editing a local author&#8217;s memoir manuscript and is an editor at <em>Rain Shadow Review</em>, an annual anthology of writing from current and formerly incarcerated writers put together by Richard Shelton and Erec Toso. Cat will be graduating from the University of Arizona in Fall 2018 and applying to Creative Writing MFA programs to further develop her fiction writing.</li>
<li>In July, I began working at the University of Arizona Poetry Center as the Education Programs Assistant, a job that enables me to combine my interests in social justice, education, and creative writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Tiny Donkey</em> archive and the work it contains will remain online for future readers. We are indebted to all the writers and interviewees who contributed to this project and to<em> Fairy Tale Review’s</em> Kate Bernheimer, Joel Hans, and Jon Riccio, who so graciously made space for this journal in the world.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">by Murad Jalilov<a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic.jpg"><br />
<img class="wp-image-908 alignright" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic-261x300.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="343" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic-261x300.jpg 261w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/muradpic.jpg 555w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Growing up Goychay, Azerbaijan, I would always hear my grandmother telling tales of old, some more interesting than others. She always told them at night in her loud-yet-soothing voice. The ones that stuck out the most were the fairy tales that were meant to frighten, such as “Adamcil” (Man-Eater), a tale of a humanoid with long horns and claws, covered in fur, eating human corpses, and “Isah and Musah,” the tale of a bird that mimics the cries of two brothers lost in a forest. These tales had a certain eerie charm to them and always blended with the mysterious nature and sounds of the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the better ways of introducing the public to a new culture is through folklore, more specifically fairy tales. As an immigrant from Azerbaijan, I’ve seen the current trends in American society where diversity is being somewhat celebrated, despite the current political rhetoric. It made me realize that I have something of my own to bring into this country and to its culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Azerbaijan’s geographical position as a country between the Middle East and Europe, surrounded by countries such as Russia, Iran and Turkey, made it an ancient hub for cultural exchange, creating a relatively unique folklore. The story that reflects this the most is “The Tale of Malikmammad,” about a young prince who journeys into the Dark World and has to face creatures from European folklore, like ogres and dragons, and a creature from Turkic folklore called the Emerald Bird (Zumrud/Konrul). There are also Azerbaijani versions of western tales such as “Cinderella” (“Göyçək Fatma”) and “The Three Goats” (“Şəngülüm, Şüngülüm, Məngülüm”). There are also plenty of tales about animals, usually with human traits, such as “Trickster Goat,” which tells the story of a goat that outsmarted a bear, a wolf, and a fox.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, a very limited number of Azerbaijani fairy tales have been translated into English, one of them being “Jirtan: The Little Boy Who Fought Monsters,” published in <em>Azerbaijan International Magazine</em> in 1996. Beyond this example, it is almost impossible to find English translations for fairy tales in the language, even for those that are known well among the Azerbaijani people, and it’s a shame that so much folklore is lost behind the language barrier. Fortunately, the age of information has connected people from around the world, making it much easier for cultures to share their heritage online for all to read and translate. Other than websites dedicated to collecting fairy tales and folklore, for me personally the web makes it easier to stay in touch with my relatives in Azerbaijan on a much more frequent basis, which allows me to ask them for fairytales that have never been recorded online or in print.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is essential that these fairy tales are translated into English and introduced to the wider public to add the voice of a culture that has been silent for years. Unfortunately, there is little interest in literarily translating Azerbaijani literature into English among those who speak both languages, and there are even fewer people versed in creative writing in English on a college level. Azerbaijani fairy tales will bring new ideas and enrich the literature that is available in English. For this reason, I have been inspired to add the cultural artifacts I brought with me, in the form of fairy tales, to the ever-growing melting pot that is the US, through literary translation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Trickster Goat </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Translated by Murad Jalilov and N.K Valek</span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once there was and once there wasn’t a group of people moving from the mountains to the plains. A Goat, a Calf, and a Sheep from the herds were in a hidden place eating grass and were not aware that their people were leaving them. When they raised their heads, however, their people were already gone. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Calf went to the Goat. “Brother Goat,” he cried, “the wolf is going to eat us! Please find us a way!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goat replied, “Let us find a hut and start living in it.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three of them agreed and started searching for a hut. Along the way, they found the pelt of a bear for the Calf, and pelt of wolf for the Goat and a pelt of fox for the Sheep to cover themselves with. After some more wandering, they finally found a hut and happily entered it, only to find a Bear, a Wolf, and a Fox having a chat.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bear spoke happily to the fox, “Grandfather Fox, please bring me a piece of wood.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fox brought a piece of wood from the corner. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bear put the wood on his chest and started singing, “Ring, my lute, ring: Today I ate a calf, and another fell down the chimney.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wolf took the wood from the Bear and sang, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a goat, and another one came to me willingly.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the Fox took the wood. “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a sheep and shall have another one!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing all this, the Goat told the Sheep, “Bring me a piece of wood.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sheep gave the Goat the piece of wood. The Goat put the wood on his chest and started singing, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a wolf, covered myself with its pelt, and I shall eat another one.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he gave the wood to the Calf.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Calf took the wood and sang, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a bear, covered myself with its pelt, and I shall eat another one.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Calf gave the wood to the Sheep, who also sang, “Ring, my lute, ring: today I ate a fox, covered myself with its pelt, and I shall eat another one.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Fox heard this, it ran out the hut, followed by the Wolf and the Bear. The Goat told his comrades, “This trick saved our lives. They will have time to think while they run and they will return to eat us. Let’s run somewhere else.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them agreed to leave. They wandered for a little, and they stumbled upon a rock. They decided to climb the rock and lie down there. Meanwhile the Bear, the Wolf and the Fox were still running. Suddenly the Wolf spoke up, “Hey, a goat, a calf and a sheep won’t be able to eat us. They tricked us. Let’s go back and eat them.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they returned to the hut, they found it to be abandoned. They followed the track of the three animals and stumbled upon a rock. They saw the Goat, the Calf and the Sheep on top of the rock. Once the Calf noticed the Bear’s scary gaze, he got frightened, slipped and fell from the rock. The Goat seeing this yelled as loud as he could:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Brother Calf, go get the bear, and we’ll take care of the wolf and the fox!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing this, the Fox ran off, and the Wolf and the Bear followed. The three herd friends laughed for a while together. Later all three of them found a way to the plains and rejoined the herds of their people. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The media is awash with think pieces on anarchism. What a time to be alive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Honestly, I hadn’t thought that within my lifetime I would see <em>black bloc</em> or <em>Antifa</em> become household words. But following the Inauguration Day protests in D.C., and in the aftermath of the white supremacist assaults and terrorist attack in Charlottesville, these terms are on the tongues of, or are at least being googled by, average Americans who never before have cracked the spines of a Bakunin volume, or even considered that <em>anarchy</em> has a meaning beyond its being maligned as a synonym for <em>chaos</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The hot takes on the ethics of violence, and the vivisections of community defense strategies are riveting, the kind of sexy that scores the clicks. What’s missing from the conversation is an examination of what the overwhelming bulk of anarchist theory really looks like in practice. The vast majority of everyday anarchists have never slung a Molotov cocktail, and are far, far more likely to regularly wield a soup ladle as their weapon of choice. Your garden-variety anarchist is probably digging in your local community garden as we speak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my experience, most of what anarchists do is feed people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, one of the most elegant illustrations of anarchism is to be found in a pithy folk tale, old and widely known, about a collective feast that burgeons from nothing but a rock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stop me if you think you’ve heard this one before.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two strangers come tramping into town. They are wretched and lumpen, and they are hungry. They ask the town-folk for something to calm their gnawing bellies, but are turned away, told at each house that there is nothing to spare.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps some of the householders turn them away because they cringe at the color of the skin the travelers wear, or because the lilt of their mother tongue sounds hateful to their ears. Perhaps some fervently claim that no human deserves food without first having earned it through the selling of their labor or the proving of their virtue. Maybe even most of the neighbors truly believe that they just haven’t got enough to share.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So the hungry two wander to the river, and at least slake their thirst. One of them pulls a soup pot from their satchel and builds a fire. They fill the pot with water and drop in a stone from the riverbed. Before long, there is a pleasant aroma. The strangers begin to laugh, they sing a little. A curious villager approaches, and then another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>We are making this fine soup,</em> they say. <em>If only we had just a sprig of herb to help the flavor.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>If only one among you had just a stump of a carrot.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>…just a scrap of potato, just a splash of oil, just a sliver of garlic…</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>a few beans</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>a golden onion</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Soon, there is a lively crowd of villagers eager to make their small contributions to the bubbling pot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everybody eats.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then perhaps somebody brings out their drum, another produces a fiddle. Perhaps there is dancing in rings and telling of stories and nursing of babies and braiding of hair. Maybe one neighbor fetches their hammer to fix another’s wagon. Maybe some older folks teach the children the names of the trees and fungi and wildflowers that grow along the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anarchism is non-hierarchical, non-coercive community organization for mutual aid and benefit. People, as equals, voluntarily sharing and helping and loving their neighbors so that every individual is cared for and the collective thrives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It may sound like a fairy tale, but it’s happening right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In hundreds of autonomous chapters across the country, anarchists in <a href="http://www.foodnotbombs.net/new_site/">Food Not Bombs</a> have been, for thirty-five years, collecting otherwise wasted food from individuals, businesses, and even dumpsters to create free meals for the hungry in their communities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They make a lot of stone soup, but that’s only the beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://freegan.info/what-is-a-freegan/freegan-practices/guerilla-gardening/">Community gardens</a>, <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/41803-antifa-and-leftists-organize-mutual-aid-and-rescue-networks-in-houston">medic collectives</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedNews/videos/1615288255158853/">Harm Reduction projects</a>, <a href="https://www.shareable.net/blog/how-to-start-a-really-really-free-market">Really Really Free Markets</a>, <a href="https://www.iww.org/content/about-iww">organizing workers</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/PortlandAnarchistRoadCare/about/">outlaw road repair</a>, <a href="https://www.theclio.com/web/entry?id=9908">rogue traffic patrols</a>, <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/organizing-prisoner-class-interview-iwoc/">prisoners’ advocacy</a>, <a href="https://libcom.org/library/tenants-union-fight-your-landlord-win">tenants’ unions</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of these things are anarchy in action.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefigurative_politics">Prefigurative politics</a></em> is often described as “building the new world in the shell of the old.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our new world has already begun, birthed from a stone in a pot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>We are making this fine soup we say.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>If only we had just a sprig of herb to help the flavor&#8230;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Vox Urbana is a seven-piece bi-national band from Tucson, Arizona that infuses Latin sounds with elements of rock. The band breaks language barriers and stereotypes through their repertoire and distinct grooves, and includes a guitar, keyboard, sax, trombone, bass guitar, congas, and drums played by a diverse roster of musicians. Vox Urbana is a small ensemble of incredible talent who aim to expand their musical horizons and share the stories of others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The band uses a style of folk music known as corridos to compose songs about the border community. A corrido is a story told in song. The word comes from the Spanish verb “correr,” which means to run, and indicates there will be a running narrative. Corridos are often about oppression, history, and the daily life struggle of those less fortunate. The band has been working on a project called <em>Cumbia Corridos</em>, a musical story-sharing project that tells the stories of immigrants crossing the border and Tucson’s marginalized denizens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I spoke with Saul Millan, the band’s trombonist, who joined the band about four years ago when he bumped into Enrique “Kiki” Castellanos, the band’s co-founder and guitarist, at a supermarket. This chance meeting catapulted Saul onto an extraordinary journey of personal growth and experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Cumbia Corridos project has helped immigrants tell their stories of struggles and overcoming challenges. How has the project influenced the band’s approach to music, as well as your personal lives?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the band, this project definitely helped shape the understanding that our music can be a powerful tool. It influences us to write music that carries a message and theme, emulating corridos&#8211;the classic Mexican-style of songwriting that includes writing a story. This was the first time I wrote on a concept album and the testimonies redirected my approach on how I composed music.</p>
<p><span id="more-886"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How did you guys choose which testimonies to convert into songs?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We choose the testimonies from people who have migrated to the U.S. from Central America and Mexico. We mostly wrote about the experience of women and non-male individuals. It is important for us to tell the stories of migration of of women, children, and the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Are the lyrics of your song, “Cuentan los Cerros,” about the brutal journey the immigrants face going north of the border?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, the lyrics talk about the experience of crossing north of the border to reunite with a loved one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What was the process like for writing your latest release,<em> La Pitaya</em>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was our attempt to further use our vocals to send a message and probe at deeper meanings in testimonies through our music. “La Piedra y La Bala” is about a young boy, Jose Antonio Elena, in Nogales who allegedly threw a rock at and was murdered by a Border Patrol agent. His case has gotten national recognition and it seemed as a story we had to talk about. We definitely had a lot to work from. This album serves as a stepping stone to our current music which carries universal themes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Is there a song from the band’s catalogue that gets a huge response from a live crowd?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Pepe Arpia” is our most requested song from a live crowd. It’s a song that condemns [former] Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s actions and brutality against minorities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vox Urbana has been described as a cumbia band that fuses its sound with elements of punk and even psychedelic rock. There are also elements of salsa, mambo, and huapango. Do you believe this fully captures the band’s musical style and goals?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I think that those things are completely true but more than anything the musical style of the group mostly focuses on other people’s experiences. Each band member is from a different time period associated with a different musical style and background. The diversity in the group is amazing. We have our bass player that is from the Netherlands. Kiki and I are from the border town–Nogales–and the rest of the members are from different cities across the country. It makes things interesting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What has been the band’s most significant or cherished moment?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can only speak from a personal stance. My most cherished moment is when we played at El Casino Ballroom and did the release for the <em>Cumbia Corridos</em> project. It brought a lot of people together. People who had painful testimonies to share and we helped them find a voice. It also helped them forget, even for just a moment, about their struggles and they just danced the night away. It was powerful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Is the band currently working on new material? If so, can we get details on the group’s future plans?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are currently working on the <em>Cumbia Corridos</em> concept album. We are just finishing on the details of this album, but we want to make sure we get it right for all of those who shared their stories with us. Our main focus is to promote this album in order for these testimonies to be heard.</p>

<p><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/unnamed.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-876" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/unnamed-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="428" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/unnamed-200x300.jpg 200w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/unnamed.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></a>The best college course I’ve taken thus far is Fairy Tales as Literature with esteemed fairy tale scholar and part-time fairy godmother, Dr. Christine Butterworth-McDermott. Halfway through covering the classics, a classmate remarked that they felt disillusioned by the tales. This shocked me. Were they really expecting Cinderella’s stepsisters to go unpunished, or Oscar Wilde’s Selfish Giant to live forever, or bread crumb trails to not get eaten by birds? Had they never heard of a jealous stepmother decapitating her child via chest lid à la “The Juniper Tree”?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a millennial, I’ve seen my peers expect fairy tale figures to fall in real love the first go-around, sans magical spells, and Neighbors Wolves to give Little Reds a break. There’s a naive desire for rabbit holes like carnival rides, to get out when it&#8217;s not fun anymore. As young people, we’ve waded for too long in the pool of Disney where everything is lovely and resolves itself. Now, sitting in a classroom being asked to engage with “The Juniper Tree” or Perrault’s “Cinderella,” it feels like a veil has been torn.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The idea embedded in “happily ever after”&#8211;that life is changed for the better in a split second, void of consequence or reality&#8211;is one that should be laughed off the stage. But when presented with it dressed like an old lady offering to tighten the corset laces of a hidden princess, there’s shock when the princess is left to flounder on the cottage floor, suffocating. Well, Bluebeard looks like the husband type, forget all those missing wives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maybe that’s why there’s an ambient sadness when Hansel and Gretel are abandoned by their parents, or Donkeyskin’s father pursues her so. It’s too close to home. Having gone to the pages to find a happy family, friendly creatures, and a predictable trajectory to follow, there can be a bitter feeling of having been tricked out of a good time. To me, that’s all the more reason to dig both heels in and reside in fairy tale literature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Generations have walked through the forest before, lantern-less and trusting. Millennials: I’m convinced we’re more fortunate than we realize. With fairytales as our guide, we can make it through, too.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>by Scott Russell Duncan</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-860 alignright" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed-1.jpg" alt="" width="255" height="339" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed-1.jpg 255w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed-1-226x300.jpg 226w" sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" /></a>Evil omen one happened ten years before the chalk-white men with beards and thunder in their hands came:  a flaming ear of corn shot in the sky and glowed like a wound in heaven. The second omen: the House of Authority burst in flames.  The third evil omen was the straw temple of the god of fire got struck by lightning.  The fourth: fire streamed through the sky on a sunny day.  The fifth: wind lashed Lake Texcoco into a flood.  The sixth evil omen was the weeping sound night after night crying, “My children, we must flee!”  The seventh: fishermen caught an odd bird, ash colored with a mirror in its head that showed the night sky. They brought the bird to emperor Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin.  He looked in the mirror and saw a vision of the war of pale men riding deer. He looked once more and the odd bird was gone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The eighth omen was me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A two-headed man was seen in the streets of Tenochtitlan.  The seers said that he was deformed. That he was an oddity. They took him to emperor’s zoo of human curiosities and eventually to the Casa Denegrida&#8211;the room with no windows painted all black in which the emperor meditated in darkness on what the seers told him. When Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin came to the Black House to see him, this evil omen, Two-Heads had disappeared.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More recent scribes write that the Mexica scribes, who recorded the omen of Two-Heads decades after the conquest, must have been alluding to the formation of the new race, the mestizo. And today, when you see me with my two heads creeping around the streets of California, it is still an omen.  The pocho, the Anglo-Chicano, the coconut. The coming again of the mixed blood, mixed culture of European and Native American.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American scribes have already foretold this through their haruspication of population science and census projections.  Aztecs called these omens evil, and likewise the American scribes portray the Anglo-Chicano with xenophobia, as a crisis to be solved, a Mexapocalypseomen of the end times of Anglo privilege. Behold the terror of the future.  Two-heads, the coming of the mestizo, the looming exotic native norm. Being led into the Casa Denegrida of your mind at night, into your dreams of who you are and what you will be.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>by Kathryn McMahon</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[Content warning: This essay mentions sexual assault.]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The protagonist’s motivation in “East of the Sun, West of the Moon” has taunted me since childhood and needled my writing. To my feminist mother’s delight, by age three I was pointing out sexism on what little TV I was allowed to watch. We lived in Maryland with my Norwegian grandfather, in whose kitchen hung a witch to ward off evil. At Christmas, tiny elf decorations called <em>julenissen</em> abounded. With a heart for magic and an eye for criticism, I read Scandinavian fairy tales, and “East of the Sun, West of the Moon” drew both my wonder and scorn.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/weast_nielsen1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-849 alignright" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/weast_nielsen1.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="546" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/weast_nielsen1.jpg 357w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/weast_nielsen1-179x300.jpg 179w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></a>In the fairy tale, a peasant gives his youngest daughter to a polar bear in exchange for gold. The polar bear takes her to his castle and forbids that she speak to her mother alone. The bear is secretly a prince cursed by the troll queen. He only resumes his human form in darkness when he sleeps with the girl. She endures this until she visits home and, “disobeying” him, confides in her mother, who gives her a candle. One night while the man is asleep, the girl lights the candle and accidentally wakes him. The troll queen whisks him away to marry her daughter. How sad that our heroine has lost her handsome, royal rapist! She must go rescue him—and suffer constant victim blaming along the way—finally winning him back with her ability to clean his shirt. Whoo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I loved the idea of traipsing through the frozen north with someone to protect me, and would later discover what a maternal archetype bears are with origins in Paleolithic bear worship. Mother bears emerging from hibernation with their cubs made bears symbols of rebirth and fertility. The “great she-bear” constellation Ursa Major has a storied past that existed long before its Greco-Roman myth. And then there is Artio, fierce protector and ultimate mama bear Celtic goddess, whose influence trickled down to my own Irish surname (McMahon means “son of the bear”). While the fairy tale evoked a Jungian response in me, I didn’t understand why the prince’s disappearance was the girl’s fault, or why she wanted him back. Stockholm syndrome was not something I knew of yet, and I remain unconvinced that wealth was her motivation. So what changed? What drove her to face death—via troll predation—to rescue her captor?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While this depends on the retelling, at an essential level, these questions spur my fiction. I write to understand people. What causes characters to act in ways that surprise themselves and even the reader? And how is this made believable?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer to both is rich character development made possible by feminism. To craft fully realized characters of any gender is a feminist act. This doesn’t mean the characters proceed as feminists. But giving them the <em>capacity</em> for the breadth of human emotion and behavior undercuts traditional forms of gender and thus creates compelling, multi-dimensional actors. And as a reader or writer, it only makes the story more satisfying when I don’t simply face the trolls, but <em>demand</em> to, prince or no prince.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Growing up, you were shy. Or maybe you were short, you were fat, you had bad teeth. You had frizzy hair, you wet the bed, you spoke with a stammer. You slept with a stuffed toy ‘til you were twelve, or ‘til you were twenty, or ‘til your monthly blood ran out and you began soaking the bed with night sweats and hot flashes and Mississippi-wide rivers of regrets. You’re almost an old woman now. Love and transcendence have passed you by. Those fairy tales you were fed by Hollywood and MTV and Hans Christian Andersen as a child, and the ones you fed yourself to get by, through the loneliness of the school playground, through the long tick-tocking overthinking of the night, through the daily treacheries of life – they all lied.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-840" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed.jpg" alt="" width="735" height="651" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed.jpg 735w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/unnamed-300x266.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which fairy tale was it you always went back to, the one you believed in most? The one with the song saying someday your prince would come? Or the one where the funny-looking little duckling (you don’t like to say “ugly” – it’s a word that’s been used against you so many times) turns into a stunner of a swan? Did you think that might be you one day? Did you really? All along, you should have paid more attention to the crone, the ogre, the unredeemed outcasts, the ones haunting the margins, or worse yet, the ordinary ones, the unmagical, the unnamed and underappreciated. Because these were your destiny – not the beautiful ones, not the princess and the swan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Or maybe the fairy tales didn’t lie. You just saw in them what you wanted, took what you needed. Beauty, hope, promises of happily ever after, some danger to make things interesting, some fear to cut through the dull of the everyday. You simply ignored the despair. Even though all fairy tales, and all life, is rife with it. Like that moment in <a href="http://hca.gilead.org.il/ugly_duc.html">Andersen’s tale about the duckling</a>, when the bullied little bird welcomes the beauty of spring and a bevy of swans with pure, piercing heartache:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">“I will fly to those royal birds,” he exclaimed, “and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter…”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">Then he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans. The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">“Kill me,” said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the next moment the duckling sees his reflection in the water, sees a swan looking back – his transformed self, his true tribe, his happily ever after. I wonder though, if the duckling had seen no change, no beauty, no swan staring back at him in the water, could he still have survived? Would he still have come to know happiness, belonging, self-love?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I need to know, same as every once and for-all-time misfit. Is there magic after all in despair? Can there be beauty in forsaken hope, transcendence without transformation, belonging when you’re the only one around to hear your own questions, a happy ending when the fairy tale, or life, or maybe yourself, is found so wanting?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Think back on the ones you paid too little attention to, while you were paying as little attention to the beauty in your worst and best self. The crone, the ogre, the marginal, the ordinary. The untransformed duckling. The resilient, the persisting, the interesting and astute, the ultimately self-accepting and wise. Lucky you – these were your destiny. The unbeautiful ones, who know how to make magic out of the most disappointing circumstances, to potion up an unbreakable spell of endurance out of yesterday’s cold pot of despair. Let them teach you to love whatever reflection stares back at you, to see the beauty in even a fantastically imperfect you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Leland Heathco, Joseph Bell (who could not be reached for an interview), and Brian Maddock co-authored a piece titled “Legacy in Red” which appeared in the 2014 edition of the </em>Rain Shadow Review<em>, an annual publication that consists of work by current or formerly incarcerated writers (you can read the story at the bottom of this post). I was struck by the powerfully executed reimagining of “Little Red Riding Hood,&#8221; in which the reader sees the concepts of power and gender reversed from the original. The red cape no longer represents a weak and startlingly naïve young girl, but instead a line of powerful women whose roles are complex and nuanced. In the same way that their characters consist of layers not previously attributed to them, interviewing these men helped me see past my preconceived notions and afforded me a richer, deeper view of a world that I had previously looked at with a certain shallowness. I encourage you to please look at the information provided after the interview about various prison writing programs and ways to become involved.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Brian Maddock is a 49 year-old kid-at-heart who graduated from AZ State University with a Bachelor’s in Computer Information Systems. He has worked in large IT departments developing and fixing software to help businesses operate. He enjoys hiking in the woods, swimming, reading fantastical stories, and public speaking. He has published poetry, essays, and children’s stories while incarcerated and would like to explore the medium of flash fiction. Brian gets a kick out of teaching beginning Spanish, computer basics, and essay writing, but enjoys learning equally well. He is an Arizona native and would love to eventually reside near the Pacific coast.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Leland Heathco was born on May 5th, 1957. He was raised in southern Alabama on the east coast of Mobile Bay, in a small farming community called Barnwell. Because of his father’s work as a pipe-fitter, the family traveled, which provided a cultural awakening for him as a young boy and gave him an early opportunity to learn about cultural diversity. Leland learned about working hard side-by-side with migrant workers on the farms. After dropping out of school in the eighth grade, his first job was working on a copper smelter down in the Playas Valley, not far from Animas, New Mexico. In May of 1975, he joined the Army for four years. He has been married twice and has four sons. Leland suffers from chronic free-spiritedness, and been to 27 states, including Hawaii. He also traveled to the Philippines, Germany, and the Isle of Crete, and firmly believes that travel is good for storytelling.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I understand that the piece was put together collaboratively between the three authors with no agreed upon theme or prevalent story line. Why do you think the story ended up as a reimagining of &#8220;Little Red Riding Hood&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BM:</strong> This story began as nothing more than a blank notepad passed among three aspiring writers, each producing one line and passing it to the next as an exercise. The first line spoke of a hunter’s moon in a forest; the next author chose to add an owl on a branch. Ultimately, the word “wolf” led to a line of thought centered on the “Little Red Riding Hood” fairy tale. From there, the “red cape” developed into a symbol for a strong line of heroines, and soon the coalesced fantasy/fairy tale emerged from the amorphous lines we all contributed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LH:</strong> The collaboration started the same way that most of my writing does. A word or a line comes to me that seems to stand out, begging for my attention, so I write it down. I’ve often thought that what I write already exists, and I’ve been fortunate that the words were given to me to write. I respect Brian and Joe as writers, and I don’t think this piece would have turned out the way it did without them. I was curious as to what might emerge if writers with different styles were to write together using a single sentence and no outline or story idea. The collaboration is the reason for the “Riding Hood” theme, which really materialized when the wolves were introduced. But, I did not want to write about Ms. Hood in the same way that she’s been depicted before. She brought herself into the story, but with a little help from me and my “Brothers of the Pen.&#8221; She is not a child, but a young woman coming of age, and coming to terms with a responsibility she does not want, however, there is honor and strength in her bloodline that will not allow her to back down from what’s before her. She is a thinker and a bad ass.</p>
<p><span id="more-826"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How did this story, focusing on strong, non-sexualized heroines, evolve in the confines of the hyper-masculine culture in prison?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BM:</strong> Certain inmates certainly fit a classic stereotype; tattooed, self-centered thieves and drug users. Many more do not. Some of us are creative, decent, humble people who led “normal”, law-abiding lives and sorely rue the day they made a bad decision and landed here. As such, the three of us respect women and feel that gender-equality should be a given in today’s world. We find it refreshing and appealing to see women in powerful roles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LH:</strong> Writing is a means of escape. If you’re surrounded by something all the time, you want to go as far away from that as possible. It’s too easy to write about macho culture because it’s so familiar. In writing about women, there’s the challenge of writing outside of a familiar mindset, and an escape to something opposite of what you are surrounded by daily. For me, it is a way to distance myself from my surroundings, which are super-masculine (or at least they try to create the illusion of masculinity). I’ve lived 60 years and I’ve known some strong women. I’ve been blessed to be loved by two. My appreciation of the beauty in life was taught to me by these women.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The generational line of women in the story showcase women’s strength. They don’t run from the forest, they don’t view the wolves as bad or are scared of them, in fact they look out for them. Women are more than I have knowledge to speak about. What I do know, I try to write into my stories. “Red” is not a woman to follow a man, nor be a mild-mannered companion. She would be an equal partner and a friend.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Do you think the environment you faced in prison had any particular influence on the piece, as far as characters, themes, etc.?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BM:</strong> I believe our lack of physical freedom led to an open forest for the physical setting of the piece, rather than a cramped apartment or crowded city! Perhaps the “old crone” came to life by witnessing how older inmates experiencing long incarcerations tend to be respected and influence behavior of other men.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LH:</strong> I never really thought it, but I suppose that is a possibility. The similarities between this place and the woods are certainly something to think about. Prison can be a dark place, so that had an influence in the setting of the woods, with this darkness being a backdrop. There are parallels between the men and wolves as well. There is the illusion of aggression, with men posturing and seeming to act aggressive as a defense mechanism. The wolves act the same way – they appear to be aggressive creatures, but aren’t in actuality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Did you pursue creative writing endeavors before attending the workshops ran by Shelton and Toso?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BM:</strong> I’d always enjoyed reading Isaac Asimov, Terry Goodkind, David Eddings, and other fantasy/sci-fi authors, but I never pursued creative writing until I signed up for the workshop on a whim at the Tucson complex of the Arizona State Prison system. I wrote software in information technology departments for huge corporations most of my life, and my writing was always technical until I began writing in prison.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LH:</strong> I started writing late in life, and I actually spent the first six months watching and listening to others in the workshops before I wrote anything, but I’ve been writing now for about 8 years. However, I have been an avid reader most of my life. My first adult book was <em>A Girl Named Tamiko</em>. I found it in a box of my father’s books when I was 7 or 8. My father was a writer, but I don’t believe he was ever published. My love of reading and writing came from my father. I told him that I would keep writing, so that someday, perhaps, our last name would be seen in a good way. I wrote a poem and a short story for him just before he passed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What does the opportunity to write creatively mean to you, personally?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BM:</strong> Creative writing acts as a mentor that prompts me to stop immersing myself in the daily grind of infinite tedium. It moves me to look at the cascade of stars above, consider a world of artificially enhanced human lifespans, or the power of a selfless, precocious child influencing a town of curmudgeons. Writing reminds me to explore, grow, and enjoy!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LH:</strong> You can be yourself while writing. It’s a way to take away the mask of anger and to let other emotions comes through. It’s an escape from the anger and from your environment. Writing is also therapy, because if you get something down on paper it doesn’t own you anymore.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People only see one side of a prisoner. Even though we are in this place, we are more than a crime or a number. We are artists, painters, wood-crafters, musicians, singers, and yes, some of us even write a little. I write, not just for me, but for everyone behind a wall, living in a box on the street, or sitting in a lonely room with no one to hear their pain; for the people society chooses to forget.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Legacy in Red</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hunter’s moon rises slowly in a cold, black sky over a forest of thick oak trees whose limbs are bent and twisted from the ravages of time and gravity. Things are as they have been since the day women stopped hunting, a long time ago.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on this night, a single shadow moves through the darkness beneath the trees, not knowing why she is in this place, knowing only that she is heeding an urge that would not be denied. She moves on an errand only vaguely understood, but driven by the need to remember.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An owl hoots in oddly deep tones, as though searching for a reason to do otherwise. Beneath its perch, two wolves pass silently, hunger pains driving them on in their search for the legend, the one known as Red Riding Hood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl does not notice these things as she steps from the trees into a small clearing. Her eyes are focused on the dark cabin before her. She hesitates, wanting to turn and run, but knowing that she has no choice. She pulls her gray cloak tighter around her, steps on the porch and reaches for the doorknob.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside, the small, wrinkled hand of an old crone places a lit candle stub in a saucer. The saucer rests on a worn table marked with runes and words from the time of magic and wildness. An old red cape hangs on a peg by the door. “Huh, one hell of a birthday,” the old woman mutters, amazed that the earth has circled the sun ninety-seven times since she first wore the cape.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature isn’t kind to the flesh, but like last year’s leaf, clinging tightly to the stem, she refuses to wither, looking for a remedy to defy mortality, while painstakingly ensuring her life’s legacy on parchment for future generations. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl is met by the crone at the door. The old woman motions her in. The girl closes the door and hangs her drab cloak on a peg protruding from the wall.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strange</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she thinks. The cabin’s warm, but stranger still is that she can see perfectly, although there is no visible light in the room where she stands. There’s no furniture, and the walls are bare. The cabin is empty except for a chest on the floor in the middle of the room.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old woman points to the chest. She motions to the young girl to open the chest and she complies. She kneels and wipes the dust from the lid, revealing strange markings. She traces them with a finger and speaks the words of a language she did not know, until now.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She places both hands on the lid, the symbols beginning to glow as she opens the chest. A voice speaks softly, coming from nowhere and everywhere at once. “This is your legacy and your destiny”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twelve portraits stare up at her, some etched in dark ink, others painted in swirls of color – generations of women, grandmothers and granddaughters, each wearing the velvet red cloak, the color of blood and huntresses. Their history is recorded on parchment and bound in a leather journal and she reads it from beginning to end. That cloak was made before women had been kept from the woods, confined to kitchens, made to stay only in the village under the watchful eyes of the priest and councilmen. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, beneath the parchment, rests a dagger in a jeweled scabbard. A blade capable of cutting the ties of subjugation, imprisonment, and complicity. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those who had come before, none had been strong enough to find their way without the trail, to defy their mothers, or to find within themselves the wildness of their ancestors.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crone, carrying the red cape across her forearms, kneels and offers it to the girl. She stands with resolve, touching her neck where the garment’s clasp will soon rest. It smells like a memory, something untamed and primordial. She remembers some old business, something about a wolf. She turns to meet the forest carrying only the dagger and her wits. She whispers to herself “This ends with me!” and steels herself for a world of trouble. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a statue near the border of Nogales, Arizona of a small boy. Every time my mother, brother, and I would walk by she’d turn to us and say that if we misbehaved or did not follow her instructions we would become a statue just like that small boy. My mother was always aided by folk tales or myths to scare us into thinking that if we deliberately disobeyed her, consequences would arise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mother is from Nogales, Sonora, Mexico. Molded by a culture full of folk tales and old proverbs, she passed on generations of stories to my siblings and I.  My mother shared the legends of El Cucuy, the Mexican boogeymann and El Chupacabra, a goat-like creature the size of a small bear&#8211;its spines reaching from its neck to the base of its tail&#8211;that haunts the desert. She also told me about La Llorona.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">La Llorona</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is told as a cautionary tale to children to make them behave properly. Different versions of the story are told depending on the region. Some say the story focuses on Maria, a woman so beautiful that all the men in her town attempted to woo her each time she walked by. Maria, with a sense of self absorption, believed she deserved the attention. She would flirt with the men but vowed only to marry the most handsome and wealthiest man she could find. The only problem interfering with her lifestyle? Her two sons. So she decided to drown them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other versions of the tale say Maria married a wealthy man and they were happy. She bore him two sons. After a time, the man would go away for long periods of time and when he returned, only focused on his sons. One day, he returned with another woman at his side and left again. Enraged, Maria drowned her two children in the river. Maria became deeply remorseful and wandered along the banks hoping her sons would return. It is said that when she finally died, her weeping spirit wandered the land, crying, “¡Ay, mis hijos!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-822 size-full" src="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" srcset="https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault.jpg 480w, https://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hqdefault-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day when I was five, my three siblings and I were playing a game of freeze tag on my grandma’s patio. Our dogs chased and barked at us. The daylight was quickly vanishing and the street lamps were turning on. As the sun set, my mother called out to us and yelled it was time to return inside. We didn’t listen. She yelled out, “¡Si no regresan ya, los va a agarrar La Llorona!” which roughly translates to, “If you don’t return now, La Llorona will come get you.” My brothers stopped playing and ran inside. I didn’t understand who my mom was speaking of because I was the youngest and had not heard the tale. I stayed outside for another five minutes and when I decided to go back, I found the door was locked. My mom on the other side said it was too late and La Llorona coming. Panicking, I begged to go inside. She hesitated. I said I was sorry for not coming back when she asked. The door unlocked and I ran inside. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat on a rusty old stool as I listened to my mother explain the importance of La Llorona. A weeping women all dressed in a white dress and her face covered by a white veil. She wouldn’t rest until she found her kids. That’s when my mom uttered the word: “Unless&#8230;” I stared at her, tightening my eyebrows. “Unless she finds other children, children who misbehave, and takes them instead.” I felt my skin lose its smoothness and small bumps started forming from my forearm to my shoulder. “La Llorona will come as soon as the lights on the street start turning on. Make sure you’re inside when the street lamps glow.</span></p>
